"Generally works great, except every time I open the app it opens on a blank white screen and I have to press the back button to arrive on the home screen. Super weird behaviour that I can't believe hasn't been fixed. Been happening for at least  months. Edit: even worse UX now... Impossible to find the Amazon fresh code without doing a search. Also I keep getting an ad for Prime when I open the app, despite already being a Prime member. Surely Amazon should be able to target these popups.",3,-1
Amazon Prime is absolutely amazing! Great products. Great prices. Shipped right to your door!,5,1
Hello I have change my phone number and since just can't connect to.my account . Plus tiping for something in particular and the apps keep showing me anything but not what I ask for .. try to reach customer service when you can't connect or make long distance calls should be easier to reach the customer services on line or by mail Need improvement,2,-1
Outstanding orders? Too difficult to find. Small upgrade to sort on outstanding orders and update marketplace orders that have been delivered would be hugely beneficial.,3,-1
"I like it alot, very easy, i love the variety of items to choose from.",4,1
"So far, I have been pleased with my Amazon experience. I had ordered a bathing suit and put it aside until I went on vacation. On vacation, I tried to put it on and couldn't get it much past my knees.It is a size XR. I needed and ordered a X. I have no idea how to return for either a credit or exchange. Help with this problem is needed. Thank you for your help.",4,1
"It's Amazon. Easy to use, easy to maintain. I use the mobile version more than the Desktop Version",5,1
"Feels sluggish, unresponsive at times, backstack doesn't work as expected. I shop on Amazon through my phone a lot and would like a fully native experience without webviews. Also should add feature to search text like Ctrl + F in browsers so I can easily find keywords in product's descriptions.",1,-1
The new update is terrible and not very user friendly. Please allow an option to hide or disable the Alexa icon on the bottom right; I keep accidentally tapping it while scrolling.,2,-1
"It's not terrible but it's time Amazon uses a native app rather than a web view, since the experience feels slow enough",3,-1
"Easy to find great deals, just always read descriptions before ordering so you don't get ripped off by shady sellers",5,1
Amazon smile. You can only turn on if your notification turned on. What is that all about. I don't need notification. Just let me donate and use the smaile service. If Amazon really cared about charity they shouldn't need me to turn on my notification to use Amazon smile. Tut tut.,1,-1
"I love Amazon! So easy, convinent and most times cheap.. There are so many varieties, you can always find what your looking.. I have been using it for years and will continue to do so. Prime makes the experience much better.",5,1
Who doesn't love Amazon?! This site offers the most wide range of deals and steals every day at any given time with fast shipping and amazing customer service when help is needed.. easy return process all around with options to credit account or refund to your pmt tender! So happy with being a faithful Amazon customer and Prime member,5,1
"Slow app. Additionally, previous order data used to load in seconds; now it sits and grinds, fails to load order information most of the time now. Please fix.",1,-1
"As of // I am unable to create reviews or answer questions. They refuse to explain anything as to why and keep sending me to my email, when I am already on Amazon, where it can and should be resolved. They apparently have become inept at best. That's what happens when businesses get outsourced to hodji. After my orders are delivered in June, I will no longer be using Amazon or their inept app ever again. Also they only get one star from me. If it could be no stars it would be.",1,-1
"Very convenient and easy. some things are over priced which isn't Amazon's fault at all. only thing I would critique Amazon on is occasionally an item will get delivered to the wrong place but the saving grace is they don't say ""you're wrong"" when you say so. So overall I'm very happy with it especially as a recluse",5,1
Unfortunately after years of being a prime member I had to delete my account today. I got tired of amazon shipping everything item I order in padded envelopes. If I leave a bad review for a damaged item they just remove it. If I order a replacement item it's the same thing over and over again. Amazon support is just awful as well. Goodbye Amazon,1,-1
"The world at your finger tips, self restraint is key otherwise the credit cards fill up fast.",5,1
You can find almost anything with this app. Very easy to navigate. Good response to search criteria.,5,1
For the most part I am liking this app l don't like not getting any help on not getting everything in English and some of the items I have ordered came in wrong I asked for replacement to get the right size but twice it was wrong one item I got twice I still don't know how to use it but overall I am happy with this app,5,1
"Amazon prime is awesome, and customer service is very helpful and they problem solve for every customer.... Thank you Amazon....",5,1
"The live streams are super anoying and start playing when you are just trying to scroll past. Also, wishlists are super buggy.  words is not enough space to list everything wrong with them. They often jump back to the top or skip around while scrolling. Items appear duplicated (but are not, so don't delete them!) And an icon of a long removed item is still the default list image... There are about  other bugs as well.",3,-1
"Well, it's a shame that amazon doesn't have connection between countries since it's the same company. I need some vitamins from amazon Brazil that don't exist in amazon UK and I can't get amazon to deliver to the UK. Disappointed with amazon.",2,-1
"Now Everytime i try to open my account, order history and complete an order with the app.. all I get is a White loading Screen.. getting ready to just delete this app off my phone.. WORKED FINE FOR YEARS",1,-1
"I would give it a  star, only challenge is the consistent crashing of the app when performing certain actions, else really intuitive and great recommendations on alternative products.",4,-1
"Amazon claims I've made all sorts of violations when I've left reviews for products. That's interesting because I've rated a few songs, but I've never done anything inappropriate or said anything rude to anyone. Have fun dealing with the Attorney General.",1,-1
"Still waiting ( years now) for my delivery instructions to be followed! I very much DISLIKE the orange pop ups now when you're shopping, makes me not want to use your app anymore, think I'll use Google instead (although they're as bad!)",1,-1
"Don't take your eye off of Amazon or you're bound to miss a great deal or some improvement they thought up. Get with it. There's a lot to take advantage of, rather than schlepping around with the rest who let the economy drag them down.",5,1
Love the app it's easy to go through and purchase items. Love that most items are reasonable unlike most they try to price gouge so you have to want out for those people.,5,1
I mean it has good quality stuff but it says free delivery but then you have to pay delivery and i think their should be more things that has free delivery but over all its a good app,4,1
"Quick and easy way to shop, especially around Christmas time. Do away with crowded shopping centres and the likes and the beauty thing is, your items are delivered straight to your door. Can even get your goods gift wrapped!",4,1
"Frustrated with how they changed comic/book buying, now you can ONLY purchase them from the Amazon website, not the Amazon app, Kindle app or even the Comixoligy app which is how I've been doing it, which made finding the next book in the series easy to find, now I end to go into the Comixoligy app, find the book, open the website and try and find it when before all I had to do was go to the series and find the new book and buy it.",3,1
"In the past few months amazon has become horrific. Terrible customer service since they took it from India, glitches with the app, poor quality merchandise, nearly impossible to get a refund, greedy, penny pinching new ways, and the icing on the cake--we can't buy digital books anymore on amazon kindle or on amazon. DUE TO THIS BS, I'VE CANCELED MY PRIME MEMBERSHIP PERMANENTLY. WILL NOT SHOP AMAZON AGAIN.",1,-1
"There are so many online shopping apps available but, Amazon is my fave by far. It's so easy to return products when they don't fit website description. No questions asked. Just be honest of course. After all, honesty is still the best policy when buying products online.",5,1
I been locked out after I was purchasing a good amount of things. And just because I ordered separately I got holds put on me and right after a purchase it asked me if I wanted to continue shopping. Well I would end up shopping. Why hold my money and still yet I get no items. On top of not being able to log in. Makes me feel robbed,2,-1
I have  account that i was able to switch back and forth. The new restrictions caused me no able to switch back. it's an inconvenient for me.,2,-1
"it's so convenient,and I love the customer service,if I ever need them they are always so helpful and courteous:)",5,1
Can no longer buy Kindle books through this app - I now have to open the website to do this. What a ridiculous situation that Google and Amazon can't work together to make customers' lives easier. Corporate greed and petty point scoring.,1,-1
Absolutely love it!!!!!!! I use this app for everything Shopping . Thanks a million Amazon. The updated version is fantastic. The UI is great and smooth love the buttons for Buy Again and orders. The tracking is superb. I just brought my Dad a Fire stick for an early birthday gift and he thinks it's great all streaming services under one roof!!!,5,1
idk what I'd do without the convenience of Amazon Shopping for certain personal items & other everyday needs! Love it ️,5,1
"As it stands I can't look at my orders through the app. It loads forever and alternating between Wi-Fi and data provider doesn't fix the issue, whereas every other app responds perfectly. Fix this, it's getting aggravating.",1,-1
Great for shopping for what you need especially for your pet. Very reliable and backed by the Amazon guarantee when a vendor fails the customer.,5,1
Its great it has almost everything I need or want for great prices! I definitely recommend you get this app! It was life changing!!!,5,1
"Dreadfully app. It repeatedly shows dozens of items unrelated to my searches, to the sacrifice of the items of interest which justs wastes my time. Applying filters makes it go from bad to worse. Shame on you Amazon.",1,-1
Update has ruined my account. Updated the app now i have to do a OTP but it doesn't send an OTP to my email. So i am now locked out of my account! Thanks amazon! I would like to close my account and a full refund for my prime since i cant even access my prime now,1,-1
"Prime was good, now it means nothing. Not next day for most prime items and can't even make the specified delivery day on those prime items, even though they set the day!",4,1
I have a little trouble navigating the app but exemplary customer service smoothed out the wrinkles. This customer service makes shopping with Amazon a pleasure after the initial headache lol. Thanks Amazon!,5,1
Big thumbs down to the new tracking for deliveries made by Amazon delivery drivers. Either the tracking is broken or the delivery drivers in my area like to drive around in circles. I watched it go by my house twice on the map. Over  minutes to supposedly make the last five stops in a  Mile area.,1,-1
"Always satisfied. Huge selections, generally great customer service. Keep in mind not always the lowest prices.",5,1
Can't cancel email notifications from this app. I get push notifications and emails too. So annoying.,4,1
Looping through the same options when im trying to return an item is extremely draining. Been waiting almost two months. Says its lost. Cant get to a point of actually returning or refunding cause it just says speak to the seller. Amazons the seller. Talk to customer support. Which item. Talk to seller. Amazons the seller. Which item. Talk to the seller....awful experience. At very least it is overwhelmingly discouraging. So appearantly im just out . Guess ill just kick rocks,2,-1
Now that you cannot shop for books in kindle app. Will you please add a more prominent link for the kindle store.,3,1
"I want to give this  stars, but I'm giving  because it is absolutely INSANE how Amazon hides the sign-out button. It should be right THERE, in front of me, maybe  click away. But no, I have to click on  lines, scroll to the bottom, click on settings, scroll to the bottom, and there's Sign-Out. I hope with  star, this generates attention. In this day and age where cyber security is so important, this is a HUGE flaw.",1,-1
"Amazon Daily Deals Are Amazing!! Low prices every day. Search without all the annoying ads. Shopping on a website that's laid out Great. Thanks to all the behind the scene ppl whom don't get enough credit. I appreciate your hard work, as many others do as well.",5,1
"Hasn't worked since last update - as soon as I open it I get the message ""Something has gone wrong our end"". Been using it for years prior to this without issue - hope they fix it soon. Update: Dev - please advise. Update: Still not working after latest update wigh same ""somthhing has gone wrong our end"" message. Update: with every update things get worse - last two updates are unusable, crashes, freezes, pictures of dogs, etc. Amazon - get some real android devs!!",1,-1
Great app can usually find everything im looking for. Only wish the dvds would always say specifically what country they are from when you go to buy them.,5,1
"nd review again one star had to cancel member staff didn't care all I wanted was to pay but no help, tell you no issue on there end and contact bank which was rubbish they take membership from same account and money in it and no approval sent to banking app rubbish service staff couldn't care canceled my membership with out any help offer laughable",1,-1
"Much improved, cleaner, more efficient, greater relevance, push adds greatly diminished. Some navigation still a little awkward, common tasks (tracking and order status) can still require too mush navigation. One suggestion: Order combination or edit prior to shipment. This would reduce email notifications.",4,1
"app works great, the new layout is easier to use with buttons across the bottom so that you can easily get to things you have ordered now. it was always a bit of a faff before. much easier to use than the previous version.",5,1
"Dude, it's , halfway through no less. Get with the times Amazon. Why have you STILL not added the simple option to enable dark mode on any android phone? Seriously, just a simple toggle, LIKE LITERALLY every other app already has now. Low star review until this basic feature is added.",1,-1
"Due to update, I can't buy ANYTHING on the apps that isn't from prime of other streaming platforms, like Starz. The only way I can buy stuff that I want is thought the website. Honesty Amazon should just pay Google that % for digital goods, they're putting us through hell to get a quick buck or two. This is so disappointing, I'm expecting after the next week, people are going to notice and the apps rating will drop and they'll suffer more then what they would have if they just payed.",1,-1
"I didn't use my acct. for a few mths. and went to sign in and I forgot my password. No big deal right? Not a chance... I had to call their horrible support office which took days to get a call back from  diff. reps,  ""accidental"" times being hung up on, refused my attempts to speak to a supervisor, and being told I have to give them my old address from  + yrs. ago or I wouldn't be able to sign in? Not to mention, this madness is all over me trying to update my old credit card...BYE  EVER",1,-1
I Love shopping with Amazon! I also Love how prompt they are how they make it so easy to shop and check out!! That's great customer service!! Thank you!!,5,1
"thank you AMAZON for making deliveries convenient for me to pick up. your return policybwas a bit confusing but manageable. Your phone agents are OUTTA THIS WORLD!! Their knowledge is extraordinary!! Most imporyant, many thanjs to the folks at the HUB, your pkg handlers. You all are the EVERYTHING!! Lastly, amazon, I've always looked at your company as a progressive entity. That being said the idea of allowing your irreplaceable workers to unionizewould be notable and definitely history-worthy..",5,1
"Language is key for finding stuff. And I find it frustrating that the app has none. I need to disable the app, eneble and update it once in a while because it keeps changing from english to french. I did not ask for that. I did not change it to french. IDGAF about Quebec's provical law about engilsh or french. My personal preferences and personal... for the bilions Amazon is worth, I think having language preferrences available in app something easy to do, it's a minimum, you own to your users.",3,-1
"I like the prices... BUT! The support team don't pay any attention to what you explain when there is an issue. Today, the lawnmower I ordered came in, the bolt is defective and the nut won't go on all the way. When I tried explaining this to customer support, the not so intelligent person starts telling me to check power connections and fuse boxes... I said absolutely noth about whether or not it turns on. I have had nothing but issues with their support team",2,-1
free returns help me feel better when purchasing products I'm not sure about. this is one of my favorite features of Amazon prime.,5,1
"Whatever you want Amazon will provide you with numerous selections differing in styles, colors, prices, and perks or benefits offers.",5,1
Amazon has definitely gone rubbish Because of their so called updates you cannot buy a film you cannot buy a film now on Amazon prime movies prime movies I even found up and said why can't I and said why can't I buy one they couldn't answer me so it's not answer me so they could not even help me I used to think Amazon was brilliant but they've really gone down here but they've really gone downhill they've tried to make something better that doesn't need fixing Bad job Amazon,1,-1
Good app easy to navigate I do wish that they stop showing things that are not related to your search but hey that's a form of advertising,5,1
Easy checkout with a $ discount first time shopping through the Amazon app! Seamless shopping using on my cell phone. Love this app!!!,5,1
"No way to get rid of the alexa button, no way to edit alexa settings, not even by following the instructions. Impossible to clean up recommended lists. Constantly refreshes and you lose your place. Photos don't load. Videos don't load. Surveys cast votes just by scrolling past, no pics or text, so I don't even know what I accidentally voted on.",1,-1
Awesome all the way around! Makes shopping easy and I can find the vegetarian food I like!,5,1
Why is it so hard to load my orders page? It keeps telling me something went wrong. I am really hoping the new update has fixed whatever is going on with the order tracking page.,2,-1
I can't live without this Amazon Shopping application. I am now dependent on it. It gets better with each update.,5,1
"Taken money without my consent twice. Can't click on anything without them taking money and secretly signing you up to prime, don't ask if that's what you want or inform you and make it very hard to cancel and get money back. I wonder how many poor people and old ones have money taken from their account every month just because they went on amazon and are unable to get money back. Or don't even know its taken. Just stop! Just coz u can (aka found legal loophole) doesn't mean u should. Stop.",1,-1
. Stars. App works ok. Would be nice if we could use our fingerprint to log in or confirm order before the transaction is made. Should be an additional security requirement before your credit card is used. Also needs a dark theme. Home menu too busy. Doesn't allow you to customize the menu.,2,-1
I fined the best stuff ever I never really ordered from Amazon prime but this is my new favorite shopping app. It has the best quality ever this app is just the best.,5,1
"Horrible, they sent me wrong thing  different times and instead of fixing the problem easy way, they want to return the item & tie money up for days. Customer service is idiots to, they can't do anything for you. DO NOT USE AMAZON!",1,-1
"Love the app, except it would be nice if the language wouldn't change to Spanish when it updates",3,1
Amazon is becoming the new ebay there is so many scalper accounts on Amazon now it's ridiculous scalping stuff you need to just basic stuff like socks or fans...,1,-1
Terrible update. Menus are all changed. Can't find the wish list. Not user friendly.,1,-1
"Love Amazon most of the time. There are very few times items dont work out. The prime benefits is a lil high priced but I guess its worth it for shipping. I don't like how prime, music, and the audible are all individually priced at $. a month. But I use Amazon by buying when I can. Living cost are get too high!!!  sheeeeesh",4,1
"I love Amazon, so easy and convenient. Using Amazon has saved me so many times especially with those last minute purchases.",5,1
My Absolute Favorite place to shop. I find things I didn't even think about and more. I compare shop. I like the quality. I like the speed of delivery. customer service is tops.,5,1
DO NOT USE THIS APP IT MIGHT BE A REAL SHOP BUT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. Customer service will not help you with anything just got told that I cannot get help from anybody for a fraudulent charge on my card so I've lost the money my account was locked and now they are hanging up on me,1,-1
"Love Amazon, use it as much as I can afford! With a new granddaughter and one on the way it's easy to shop Amazon. Love Amazon Prime free shipping, its AWESOME!!",5,1
"when I need anything , seems like Amazon has it and it's in stock. these days I order from Amazon because nobody else has what I'm looking for. I am very much pleased and satisfied with my Amazon orders. ",5,1
"Constant late deliveries, Prime is not worth it anymore. I will not be renewing my subscription.",1,-1
"Ordered many, many, many items, from AMAZON, with only a couple of minor problems, that is quite exceptional to me... I would Recommend AMAZON to anyone, wanting Quality Products, at an affordable prices, the more you order Remember, the more you save...  STARS &  % FOR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION...",5,1
I love shopping here. Easy to understand & finding things is easy. Helpful My place to go for online anything. Can find what is needed. Prices & Delivery's are rite on. Thanks Deb,5,1
Another go to source for me it caters to everyone of my needs and provides them at a reasonable price. Bulk items come in handy too. Subscription for various medical products is quite useful and I am a proud member of the prime membership for nearly  years. That program is bountiful so many uses within Amazon truly amazing.,5,1
I have lost all trust in this company in this company as I got billed not only for my Amazon prime But Amazon music also charged me a one year subscription fee that I never even asked for Besides that about every rd package that I order seems to get lost or delivered to the wrong address,1,-1
"Good app, always find what I need. If there are issues customer service quickly addresses and resolves the issue.",5,1
"Apparently, there was an update recently. This seems to be associated with the app freezing when I look up previous orders on my Samsung AS phone. Previously worked perfectly.",3,1
"The motion and movement all makes me dizzy feeling and stressed, Id love accessibility options to make things not move around and move so much and be more simple",1,-1
I love shopping on Amazon because you get your items really fast and it's good quality items. I haven't had anything that I have gotten from Amazon that I need to ship back to Amazon. So I give it a  stars,5,1
"Amazon is my go to for just about everything from groceries, gym equipment,glasses, supplements. There is nothing they don't have . I am pleased with the deals and find myself never having to go to the store, and with gas prices the way they are it can save you monet that way as well.  %off on baby products if you have a membership, which is a no brainer.",5,1
"Amazon started a Prime membership for me without any authorization or action on my behalf. Good job, you lost me as a customer for good. Don't take people's money without their permission!",1,-1
"The app is mostly good but has weird design choices. For example there is a feature to switch from a personal to business account so you can order business stuff from the business account but once there you cannot switch back to the personal account cause someone forgot to design a button or link for it so you are trapped, there is not log out button either on the business screen so you are forced to uninstall and reinstall the app to log into the personal account again. Bad design thinking.",2,-1
/! nothings perfect because we're humans. thanks to all the employees that bust their tails to make life easier for other!,5,1
super convenient but not always the best price but to balance they are very good with customer service,4,1
Due to pride advertisements and gay ads I've canceled my service and removing the app. There should have been a opt out option. I believe such content is inappropriate.,1,-1
"Used to be a great place to order something needed ASAP. However, I no longer see the benefit of Prume shipping if it is consistently arriving late. Stop advertising -Day Shipping if you can't deliver on time.",2,-1
Since the update it's worse. Really slow and doesn't seem to react sometimes. Disappointing. Used to be a good app.,1,-1
"What's the point to have an app if I can't manage my subscriptions from it nor from your website! I wanted to sign up for prime and it's ridiculous, not from prime app, not from amazon app, nor from the website it possible! If you wanna make money do something about it!",1,-1
Last  times i have bought in the last  months each have came either damaged or item was half gone in a sealed container. Wipp only be ordering books from now on. Sellers and amazon need to be help accountable for bad repeated service,1,-1
"The app has literally failed to start up! I just downloaded the app and clicking sign in....it just stalls and stalls....till it says my login has failed without any input. When I choose create an account, it just stalls forever!!",1,-1
"Now that it is now longer possible to download books via this app (or via the kindle app), what we're supposed to do is use the app for making a list, and then use a web browser for downloading what we have saved on our list. Ridiculous. I understand this is a Google Playstore restriction, but it has made this app useless.",1,-1
"Terrible app. Amazon won't give support without this app, yet this app doesn't work!? So they've charged me for products that they've not delivered, and then made it almost impossible to contact them. I've reinstalled this app multiple times, but not once has it logged in, every time I try the app crashes and tells me to log in again. This is what happens when big companies habe no competition, they get greedy and lazy, nothing but disgusting thieves now.",1,-1
"always good delivery and always have the things I never thought existed plus I get  day delivery, streaming TV books etc this is the best thing I subscribe to",5,1
Just awesome service every time I deal with Amazon. Thank you to all of the workers from customer service to the delivery driver's.,5,1
"Hi! I love Amazon. This app is pretty good though it takes some time to find what I need. But what is extremely irritating is Alexa button in the right bottom corner. It blocks the view, opens by itself when I try to press something else. How to get rid of it? I never use Alexa. Does anybody know how to disable it? Thank you!",3,-1
Love Amazon service. Quick delivery. Only setback is cost of shipping.,5,1
Shopping on Amazon can sometimes be tricky and very pleasant at other times. You have got to understand how they work and open your eyes and sense. You may find an offer at one time and lost it. There are some very good offers but you must be very fast in getting them.,4,1
It's been great to me more then not but as of lately they keep saying the package is delivered days before the package arrives if it arrives at all. Amazon is getting to big and it's starting to show from their lack of attentiveness.,4,1
"Won't let me add alexa due to a ""bug"" not happy. I have looked for updates for  weeks now and have also uninstaled the app and reinstalled it and it's still not working",2,-1
"Can't purchase kindle books on a shopping app never heard such nonsense. It's either a rort to make you visit full website or google needs to pull their heads in and let people use the app for shopping which includes kindle books it is a purchase. What's the difference a purchase is a purchase or are Google trying to force you onto one of their ereaders, seems very odd inconveniencing people like this. Appears Google forcing companies onto their billing system disgusting",1,-1
I love this app. I buy many products from Amazon. I can compare prices from home. I have no problem loading my pages. To have a great shopping experience with the Amazon app. people need a good update computer or tablet. If your device it's old it will be slow loading the app. and you are going to be disappointed.,5,1
"Decent app-BUT, it WILL NOT save the locker address for some reason. This started several months ago. I have to continously select the delivery location (a local locker) every time I open the app. Aside from that it's a good app!",4,1
they always deliver on time. with a quick fix if something is wrong with an order,5,1
"Wow, purchased multiple clothing items for my mom and I, which all fit perfectly. Prime quick delivery and great service",5,1
Outstanding shopping experience. Unique with its own style and excellent prices.,5,1
"Sucks lately. Both the web page and the app suck after last update. Its slow, glitches, freezeing when watching videos or kicks u out of app, if not fixed will have to shop else where for holidays",4,-1
"Honestly they just keep taking my money. They sneak me Amazon prime for ""free"" so that they can keep making money off my card. I'm in so much debt and they are still hitting my account.",1,-1
Thanks for nothing! I tried to sign up for Amazon Prime with my EBT card on my phone. Which I used to be able to do. Now it says I cannot sign up for Amazon Prime on a mobile device. I am elderly and I have no one to help me to sign up for it. I tried calling your customer service all I did was keep getting the runaround. I tried your live chat. The person did not even try to acknowledge my question. I recorded the phone call and screenshot the live chat. They are going on social media pages.,1,-1
Hello I was just saying that Amazon will be a great shopping spot to look at a couple of outfits go and check it Out. Yvonne You can find a lot more than you think look for head to toe go on you love it,5,1
"You MUST ENSURE I R receiving FREE SHIPPING U GET BEING A PRIME MEMBERSHIP.......I DELETED  ITEMS CUZ SHIPPING WAS $. !!!! THAT IS JUST STUPID..... LESSENS MY ITEMS I CAN GET NO SHIPPING COST IS WHY I 'TRIED"" PRIME MEMBERSHIP TO GET FREE SHIPPING. ON ITEMS I BUY ON AMAZON . RIPP OFF.. .. DON'T PAY a penny for PRIME MEMBERSHIP.........",3,1
"Love Amazon! You can find so many Amazing things an I highly suggest getting Amazon prime so you can get free and fast shipping, you also get to read books, play games and watch tv shows and movies on Amazon prime.",5,1
"Slow at the best of times, crashes when it wants to be more annoying. One would be safe to assume that the most current interation of a product would be, at the very least, an upgrade of the previous few product it was replacing but do not expect that from this app as of June , . Preferably, it would be the best out of the entire line, but that would be asking too much. Heck, I would even take something developed by a teen ""dark web hacker"" over whatever this thing is. Thank you Amazon.",1,-1
"Best shopping app out there. Works super smooth, easy to use. Love it.",5,1
"When did ya'll start allowing anybody to change passwords for someone else without their permission? I went through hell to rescue MY accounts and I couldn't do it via this app. I'd thank you for sending me an email telling me the password was hacked - except YOU ALLOWED THE HACK! Also, if I'm forced to speak to Alexa to order, I'll cancel my account. It doesn't understand my words. Yet it blocks my shopping to talk, and I have a speech impediment. ADA! Look it up!",1,-1
"Can't buy kindle books, which I understand the reasons for, but everytime i click on the website, it automatically opens the app whether I want it to or not. Which. I. Still. Cant. Buy. Kindle. Books. On. Why are you making it so hard to buy Kindle books? Nevermind, found out you can turn off supported links in the app, so can now access the website. Im guessing this was part of the latest update?",1,-1
"Why does everybody upgrade their apps to be worse than they were before? This upgrade slows everything down, they have changed everything around, it is harder to find your orders and other things. Why find a way to make something that's working fine into something more aggravating? Hate this upgrade. Oh also since this upgrade every . seconds they send you recommendations spamming your inbox.. with no way to stop it",1,-1
"I  Amz.  Easy shopping, (mostly) free shipping, quick deliveries, easy returns, etc. Since Bezos sold it... it's changed (& NOT for the better) MANY changes that DIDN'T need to be. Many MORE that NEEDED but DID NOT GET changed - . Bulk edits for lists, etc . Payment options - use Gift Card ONCE or ALWAYS  (I ONLY use GC for AMZ PRM VIDS, NOT the store. . More crashes, closing down, etc. I've reopened & reinstalled this app a LOT & STILL happens PLEASE, FIX THESE!!! 'TIL THEN - ⭐  SORRY!",3,-1
"Great price and I get exactly what I expect. However, once in awhile the tubes come in smashed that is the only reason for  stars instead of .",4,1
Good app so far. Just recently have not been able to find where to subscribe to prime since I unsubscribed a while ago. Absolutely infuriating due to the app sending you down a rabbit whole of dead ends and useless information regarding Amazon prime. Please fix the app!,3,-1
"great for what it cost,no point in starting the car and paying for parking, get what you need the next day",5,1
"i love shopping on Amazon! They are super fast, returns are v quivk and easy, and products are % guaranteed! what more cld u want?!",5,1
I love buying almost everything on Amazon. Not too sure about furniture though. It's convenient and great customer service / .,5,1
Refuses to offer refund or replacement. I bought an item for my sons birthday went to open it and it was severely damaged the box didn't show any signs of damage. It past refund policy because of course I didn't open the item before I have it to my son. And unlike most people I buy things in advance. Amazon says it's the rd party seller but they refuse to budge. This item was over $ so not cheap but left with a pile of trash since it is completely busted! I'll file a small claims suit,1,-1
"An error message is displayed every time I open the Amazon app. And when I am try to buy something, it shows the same message. Below is the error message and the details of the mobile I am using. The error message I receive: ""UH-OH Something went wrong on our end."" Device Details: Samsung Galaxy S+ G (SM-GB/DS) Android Version: ",1,-1
Terrible !!! This app all of a sudden decided I was Spanish & changed the Language.... I need it back to ENGLISH & can't find where to go to change it back !!!!,1,-1
"I LOVE the ease of purchasing transactions, including returns through the app. The only thing that prevents a  star rating is that I'm not always able to view the product videos. When reading through reviews I usually get kicked off the app.",3,1
Very convenient! Tho in one point they had failed me to change my address and customer service couldn't even do it til that I have to cancel my order that I need it so bad! But its all good.. overall experience I am still satisfied..,5,1
"Used to work well and it still would except it seems to randomly decide that I speak Spanish and resets itself to that language. I have no idea why, but once it does that I have a hard time figuring out where to change it. It's really becoming a pain in the a$$.",3,-1
"We absolutely love the app, not  with the delivery system but it's been getting better. Thanks",5,1
it's a very nice app so nice infact that I'm always using this app for my model kit hobby. And thank you Amazon employee for all that you do.,5,1
" I like amazon,in shopping with them make everything much better,to have first hand, when looking for a item.",5,1
"Love shopping Amazon Fresh. Every order has been correct, some deliveries in just hour or - days. I have mobility issues, ordering thru Amazon is so convenient. Keep up the Great work.",5,1
"Now I can't buy any books on the app nor kindle AND when I go onto my browser on my phone to buy, it redirects me to this app. So backwards! Do better, billionaire.",1,-1
"The app used to be simple to use. It was easy to open, click on orders icon on main page to see what and when orders were arriving. When app update I now have to go to several pages to do the same thing. When I sign in if I want to go shopping I will but now forced to go through pages of suggestion to get to my orders. Don't like the update at all. This is why I give  star. Like they say if it not broke don't fix it.",1,-1
"Good app but like % of the time i order an item from a rd party seller amazon says my order is arriving by a date and even after it is delivered it still says it is arriving on a date, and then on the estimated delivery date it says arriving today by pm when i already had it for a week or a few days, and then after it says my order is running late, and sometimes it says your parcel maybe lost after it passed the now expected date, and i have the item, also does that on the browser as well",4,1
I love Amazon shopping. I buy a lot of stuff off of it. It's easy to use and the prices are fairly decent most of the time.,5,1
"It so convenient, its the best for shopping. And the return procedure is pretty painless.",5,1
"I use Amazon for pretty much everything. I always filter on Amazon prime and my shipments are never late. Also, the return process is so easy! Free shipping free returns as long as you're a prime member.",5,1
"Everything works fine, very fast access, I enjoy the ease of using the app.",5,1
I've gotten several emails saying they haven't received items I returned and that they were going to charge me for them. So I go through the long process of calling and talking to someone only to have them tell me that my account shows it was received. So I'm left wondering what's really happening with the return and how closely I need to watch my account for false charges.,3,1
"I've been an Amazon Prime customer for several years. I don't have an issue with the software or customer service, Returning items is simple. However, my only issue lies with Prime delivering items within / hrs. If I have to wait / days tops I feel that Prime isn't working out entirely for me. With the exception of free shipping but not the quick turn around that you have come to expect. Other then that, Amazon facilitates shopping online. Spending money has become way to easy. lol",5,1
"The systems made many charges, I called it and they explained that was impossible because it is perfect the system. So I had to pay your error. Bye Amazon",1,-1
Usually reliable. Challenging depth of features are difficult for me to get through.,4,1
"For the most part the app runs smoothly. Every now and then it lags or gives different items than asked for. But, I like the app and will keep using it.",4,1
"The worst app ever. It's incredibly difficult to navigate and because they've attempted to load almost every feature provided from Amazon in this app (the account page is insane), the most basic services glitch and fail, ie. Loading a zoomable image from your phone. You're lucky to get / pictures showing up when you click to zoom, and that's all you'll get forevermore from that listing. All that money and can't even make a decent app? Maybe make one only to shop so it's like other store apps?",1,-1
I like the idea that you can get your order shipped fast and if return is required very simple,5,1
"I don't hesitate to recommend Amazon for All your needs. Excellent quality, price,and delivery.",5,1
"What did you do?!? I used to love the app, but after updating today (//), it's messed up. Why can't we buy Kindle books in the app anymore?!? STUPID idea! Bring back Bezos! At least he knew what he was doing! I would give this update  stars if I could!",1,-1
"If want to change the delivery date, good luck to you, it never seems to work for me nor does the bundling of orders, its amazon's way or no way. A great app but not if you want or need more control over delivery alternatives. Hard to believe I know, but the delivery service as got worse rather than better, the estimated time of delivery keeps changing, which is a bit awkward if you want to make plans.",1,-1
"Very easy to use, can pair with Alexa, almost no ads, and overall just good.",5,1
"Ok, I originally left a one star review in the hopes that someone on the IT or Tech teams will see this and start to 'hash' out a solution to this one problem. Multiple times I've had to cancel an order, just to go in and change the ""special instructions"" for my delivery. They should make it so you can edit that part even after the order has been placed. Nothing else, just the instructions in case something unforeseeable comes up. Other than that it's a functional app.",4,-1
"Amazon shopping is very convenient most of the time and shipping is generally quick. often enough though, the delivery date gets moved back after the order is placed and you have to make adjustments for later delivery .",4,1
Heard you are not going to be able to buy ANYTHING through Amazon app with new Google play store policy which has already affected Kindle books and Amazon videos. So dumb! Google is getting worse than Apple!,1,-1
"It would be useful if you could rate the delivery driver per delivery rather than for each individual package delivered. For example, if you have numerous packages automatically delivered each month on a particular day it is impractical and too time consuming to leave individual ratings.",1,-1
love to shop in Amazon only bcoz I know I get good quality products very fast delivery. I had been shopping in Amazon since more than  years. excellent,5,1
"The latest upgrade is horrible. I cannot logout so I end up logging out via kindle and losing all of my downloaded books daily. Hate it. And would prefer reverting to the app prior to the upgrade, but of course there is no option....",1,-1
"If you block ANY ads, the app throws up an ""UH-OH Something went wrong on our end."" page, rendering it completely useless. This, despite the fact that everything else loads just fine until the error message appears. Still an issue as of May .",1,-1
"Have loved Amazon for years. However, it has developed two problems: first, delivery times are getting slower and slower, and second, more and more good products have disappeared when I try to reorder.",3,1
Ever since the update in early may this app has went downhill. It removed my shortcut icon and doesn't even show in my apps unless I search for it. No longer user friendly,2,-1
"I really satisfied with the products that i have ordered, and it was delivered quickly and safely..",5,1
"The app has a nasty bug that it doesn't properly show ""revise payment"" page and orders got canceled because I can't open the revise payment page!!! The bug has been there for months, and the support said that they already knew about the issue!! WTH?",1,-1
"Fit Bit connection complications... I love Amazon but this resent update kick my fitbit off Alexa. When I try to reconnect Alexa in the fitbit app it just says there is something wrong with you Amazon shopping app, please update the app and try again. There obviously is no update for either apps so I can't do that. Please just fix this I like my Amazon Alexa on my fitbit, it is very helpful.",5,1
"I just LOVE IT Amazon has always had what I'm looking for, I'm a prime member so they also stay to their word when they say will be a fast/prime shipping  & the drivers had always be careful with our packages   I'm a very happy & loyal customer, thank You to all the Amazon team!",5,1
"I love Amazon, the website is easy to use and there's a variety of different things to buy. the only thing is it can get glitchy sometimes",4,1
"convenient! Be sure you set up yur Amazon smile charity and keep it updated so a portion of purchases go to the charity you select. If tour order doesn't say Amazon Smile, set up needs completed or refreshed.",5,1
Package says it arrived when it never has and half the time it gets delivered at the wrong mail room even with detailed Instructions for delivery. I have to check twice half the time and at both locations,1,-1
"Amazon has made shopping much easier, it has also caused me to use bad judgment on making purchases a very few times. It also makes it very easy to correct my mistakes with free returns. I love shopping at Amazon.",5,1
I love convenient services that allow us more time with our family's. Not having to Chase bargains from store to store . Amazon has it all.,5,1
Cant purchase movies through the app anymore so this app became less relevant. Might as well just bookmark amazon on your browser. Terrible,2,-1
"I prefer the old version to this!!!! I literally bought £, £ and £ gift card yesterday and when I wanted to use them today it said the card has already been redeemed. By who??? This is really pissing me off because I used all my last money to buy it. I can't even find customer service on it",1,-1
"easy breezy way to shop on Amazon, check the status of your orders, or download/screen capture labels for returning items to Amazon.",5,1
"Latest update is a huge dissapointment! The app is incredibly slow to load, I haven't seen something so slow since Internet Explorer... In the previous version, the account dashboard was so easy to access, now it's like going through a maze to access anything... Trying to track your parcel to get an idea when it will be delivered? I think you've got better chances of catching G network on a flying plane. This ""upgrade"" was a total fail...",1,-1
"This is my go to shopping app, whether I'm really intending to. buy from amazon or not. Their brilliant search engine typically finds the CORRECT name for the gizmo I'm looking for, while ratings and current pricing help me decide if it's really worth the purchase. LOVE IT.",5,1
It works so great and you can't belive how fast the packages came . I will order it the before and then the next day it will come to my door. But some of the stuff takes like - days. It is good you should download the app.,5,1
stars simply for thr horrible retune option. They require you to go to a ups store and have them scan a QR code to print the label. UPS STORE ONLY! The hubs or whatever they are called that are inside other stores only ship pre packages and pre labeled items. Closest store to me is about a  min drive so imagine how difficult it is for someone who doesn't have a car to get there. Contacted customer service and they sent me the same thing again!,3,-1
The prices are sometimes not the best if you look around but all and all prime is where it's at. Love the lights I got for my bedroom,5,1
"It's good but one problem; when I go on the app, and click on the basket, it keeps on pulling up advertises and can't access the basket. Please fix this.",4,1
"Have to say, enjoy shopping from my Amazon app, very good choices and very good prices also excellent details about dispatch, tracking and delivery also past purchases.",5,1
"I love Amazon! I do most of my online shopping through Amazon, they have everything! The app is so easy to use, you can find anything you want, and checkout is really easy I highly recommend this app to anyone who shops online, you'll find what you're looking for here!",5,1
They started delivering my packages to the other side of town... I have talked to  different people and can not get this fixed. My head is spinning with the level of stupidity that must take place in this company.,1,-1
Super easy to navigate and understand. I've got to use strong discipline to not go broke. I absolutely love this app and service.,5,1
It runs smoothly but it uses so much battery and background data. Amazon bring back the old app. Changed to  because we dont want Alexa on a simple app.,2,-1
delivery has been late too many times. Amazon needs to get back to  day delivery.,2,-1
I think it's funny that there are alot of old people who don't know how a touchscreen works and complain about how easy it is to tap something and blame the app,5,1
"Leah Jenkins a very good and reliable personal friend of mine turned me on to Amazon's website. I was hooked before the pandemic of  . But really sold me during. They are a very large outlet this is true and the majority who are employed there have been known to occasionally make human error , but if you call them on it they always make good the shipments they send. So don't be discouraged should a mistake happen from time to time. But it gets better "". ""Thanks""James h Shurley aka Jimi ~",5,1
Subscriptions? Please tell me why I can't cancel my subscriptions through the app now? And when I try to go online through my phone to cancel it takes me straight to the app.,1,-1
"Let me start out by saying I love this app, but it also sucks. . I bought multiple items with Amazon gift cards and I can't review them because apparently it's not a valid method of buying a product. My account is set up and the only thing holding me back is I don't have a credit/debit card. . You can't organize things in your cart/wishlists. I really would like to do this easily. . The Amazon team needs to start filtering out the products a bit more, and discontinue sketchy ones; /- star?",2,-1
"What is this ALEXA in my notification bar. I can't clear it, it's obnoxious. Permanent notifications in the notification bar is TERRIBLE app design. In fact, all of your apps are terrible, so this doesn't surprise me. You know what does clear the ALEXA notification that I can't clear otherwise? Uninstalling your stupid app.",1,-1
Convoluted and difficult to use. Even the Icon is ugly. I wish I could switch it back.,1,-1
good all round quality and prime delivery makes it even more easier to get items when you want them,4,1
I love it because it's very addictive maybe not so healthy but it do serve a purpose in time when you can't get out of the house  ️ and  Love waiting for the delivery truck that's sad,5,1
"Love this app so much!! Such an easy app to use, the functionality is fantastic. I do recommend having a prime account so your items don't take so long to ship",5,1
Easy to use and great service. Lots of shopping items available. Easy to fine what you need in one place .,5,1
Good and easy to get what I need. Affordable at times . Being lazy to go the road at I can make my harder on Amazon .thank,5,1
"Easy to find what your looking for, and delivery is good too. I've ordered a lot over the years and sometimes it's been an emergency and it always arrives in the specified times",5,1
"My go to shopping app! I love how accessible most items are, and with my prime membership, delivery is fast and convenient. The amount that i save every year is well worth my membership fee. And the excellent customer service makes me feel confident in my purchases.",5,1
"It always says an error has occur and it wont work, and when it has my order has apparently been sent turns out nobody had worked on it got it supper late and not what i had order!!!",1,-1
The previous app was very intuitive and great to use. This new version is horrible. Even E-bay is better than this app.,1,-1
"I have ordered many times and many items, all arrived quickly, except first time, when my safety shoes delayed. I contacted Amazon they refunded my money. Then the shoes arrived and I had nothing to pay, because of that delay. From electronic devices to clothes, everything was fine and fast arrived.",5,1
I can't write a review because it says there's not enough characters and some other bs. Tried multiple times won't let me. Guess it's a bug or something. Just like Brandon I'm equally disappointed.,1,-1
"Overall awesome, wishthere was a faster way to add items to lists tho like a button or a heart instead of having to click on each indivudual item in order to add to a list. Also wish you could see the subtotal of items in a list. Also wish you could choose what the cover image of a list is",4,1
Absurdly improfesional/None existent customer support. I really really really cant get this across enough but buy locally or anywhere else but here % of the reviews are faked so you have better luck buying quality from the literal black market so buyer beware I recommend getting screwed anywhere else,1,-1
"Mostly I have had good luck, with buying from Amazon, except for when I recently bought a New electric chain saw, that broke, the third time that I used it.",5,1
Love the variety of products available on Amazon. No matter what the needs are for our Animal rescue ... we can find it on Amazon. And its delivered right to us. That saves us a lot of time.,5,1
I would love it if the alexa icon is removable. I accidently keep selecting it when scrolling if right handed.,3,1
"//: I'm on the Prime Free Month. I see WholeFoods delivery is No Longer Free. Please someone tell me a Good Reason for paying $/year for Prime? BTW: I stopped Prime in , I couldn't see the benefits at that time. I am not a continuous Shopper, except for Food and Necessities.",3,-1
"I always love thinking of an item, then finding it on Amazon. Most of the time it is cheaper as well.",5,1
I'm so tired of this app. I ordered $ worth of things yesterday and then they suspended my account and stole my money. What a rip off! Still hasn't been shipped to me yet and I'm pissed. UPDATE: still haven't got my money back and no packages been told that I got my account back yet I can't log in and I won't get a reply via email.,1,-1
"Great experience! I don't have to go out shopping and when I order and something goes wrong,I return it and my money goes back to my ac",4,1
It okay but when you get a different phone it wont let you login with the same password and notify old phone instead of your new phone,4,1
"Refunded item take to long to get refund, when they could have reordered item, now I have to wait and wait - days to get refund when it takes them seconds to take your money And thier computer system likes to auto correct to wrong address so triple check that",2,-1
I love my Amazon app. It stores my password securely so I don't always have to sign in. The app works perfect. Only occasionally doesn't get stuck when I'm trying to add something to a list. I would recommend this to anybody. The only thing I don't like about it is I can't use my talk to text on it,4,1
I live in Hawaii so using the Amazon shopping app makes it easy for my family to obtain items that we can't find on island. The delivery may take a few days given our geographic location but it's still pretty fast. We have subscriptions for alot of regularly used home items that's makes our lifestyle convenient. Convenience is something we appreciate since we don't have the ability to stop time. Amazon is a great fit for All families.,5,1
I have had no issues with the Amazon App. I have always been able to order what I have needed and able to find what I need. I find the app easier to use than going on the computer itself,5,1
The chat feature on the app doesn't display the text and it's hard to get back into the chat once you go on something else,3,1
Won't allow pharmacy screenshots or invoice download for hsa. Search is still bad - can't select custom dollar ranges in filter. I tried to say I'm my review that a product had an offer to pay the buyer $ for a  star review and Amazon said that's against the rules. You can't trust reviews and Amazon doesn't care as long as they make a profit. Unethical,1,-1
"Who doesn't have this app for shopping; is missing alot. Just like my husband who doesn't like using his phone for anything online but prefer his computer     I love love Amazon app and I have had the best experience       You get notifications when you order is delivered, you can chat to rectify your problems with the incredible customer service, there is more when you have it.",5,1
"Great app, the first time I used it I had a problem with it but now works great. I think the updates cleared the problem.",5,1
"LOVE me sum AMAZON This app is so easy.. And the money i save in gas is huge!! EVERYTHING i need is at my fingertips, just a few clicks away!",5,1
"Very poor service never take prime membership to get fast or next day delivery, prime is just a money making stategy of Amazon, I took prime and it's taking more than three days to deliver prime products but the customer service will always keep on saying it happens only in special cases, but it's not the first time happening for me they already took my money for prime and playing with my emotions and time.",1,-1
I'm unable to switch between accounts with the Android app while I can with the desktop URL. This is frustrating when attempting to track a package from my phone.,3,-1
"Was a great app, we used all the time now my orders won't show up. Last update got them to show up for about a day, but back to not showing again.",2,-1
"Used to be a fast efficient app for shopping. Now it's slow, hangs constantly and crashes. I spend more time waiting for it to load than actually shopping and buying. Save yourself the trouble and shop via browser. It is much faster",2,-1
Terrible customer service. My stuff was delivered to the wrong location and Amazon did very little to help and there was no communication about anything.,1,-1
"I have had I problem with this site I ordered a phone case and they charged me for it . When o got it iw was the wrong case , mind you it was the second time buying the case. It was a buy again choice. So I contact them and they said to return it to some place I couldn't get to at the time , and said they would send me the right case. Well the second case is the wrong case also so now I may be the nut sitting with  classes that are useless to me because they are not returnable by mail.",5,1
I love Amazon prime! It well worth the price. Amazon makes shopping easy. You get your orders quickly & if any problems with your order they are easy to contact & to get you a refund if necessary.,5,1
"If you searching for some particular item why appears some other stuff that u not even need it, this is annoying, you guys need some classes from Ebay, If you search for specific item for a  bmw i OR other cars why you guys showing stuff that is not even for your car or not fit on your car, WHY?????",2,-1
I like the last App better because it was easier to use for making returns. It feels like the new App is better for Amazon making SALES & NOT about making it easier for Me to BUY what I need.,1,-1
"Whatever was done to this app needs to be undone. It's slow and unresponsive. Most product options don't load, nor do product pics. Horrible update. Please fix this.",1,-1
"Amazon is so easy to use prices r good , good with returns or exchanges , packages come on time ......it makes life easy for me......thanks amazon",5,1
"Hi Amazon, I am so thankful for you customer support and offering prime student to me. It is such a big help when I am juggling between being a single parent , a full time job and a full time student. I really appreciate. Thanks",5,1
Good deals to my door  But updates break something everytime. Should be a easier way to see sellers store on mobile. Also communication with seller should be easier.,3,1
"Just easy, fast and reliable, even refunds are easy as long as your honest.",5,1
Amazon has everything! I love amazon so much and would rate it  stars if possible! I would also recomend to anyone who loves online shopping. I also feel like it is a great app for people who even dont like online shopping it just has everything! From art suplys to gardening tools to make up to kids toys to gaming sets to anything!,5,1
I got delivered a damaged item and tried to leave a negative feedback twice. The review is not shown in the product's reviews. Amazon is now playing dirty tricks by choosing to only show good reviews on the products? Getting worse than Ebay.,2,-1
Love the easy ordering and returning process. I have never had a bad experience in the last  plus years.,5,1
"This latest update is so frustrating. I am unable to find where to buy or rent movies. Prime Video says I have to go to the Amazon app to actually buy/rent any movie. The Amazon app doesn't have a place now to actually buy/rent. The movie (Rocky) says it is available but there isn't anyway to actually purchase it. Also on Prime Video, there is an extra step to access my purchases where before, that was the page that loaded. Very frustrating. Poor design.",1,-1
Please stop using other delivery services to deliver packages i don't have this app for no reason that's why I didn't just use a different website specifically because of the fast reliable shipping please fix this,2,-1
After the last update had nothing but problems just keep getting the something has gone wrong screen whatever you click on just get the same have unstalled it and reinstalled its still the same,1,-1
"Wow, I thought the bugs & glitches in this app were bad enough back in February. Apparently things haven't improved much since then!!! Since their so called ""updates"", app is SUPER slow & still gives issues with loading pages. Apparently Amazon doesn't care about all of the customers & money they're losing. Guess I'll stick with eBay or Walmart because this is ridiculous. I don't have any issues with any other apps. FIX THIS ALREADY, HOW HARD IS THAT TO DO AFTER MONTHS AND TONS OF COMPLAINTS!?",1,-1
"Keeps saying, Oops, something went wrong on our end. Go back to home page. Uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. Getting worse not better.",1,-1
"Easy to use, very convenient as far as next day and free shipping, lost items, returns and refunds. There has never been a hassle in my case, anytime I've had an issue with a purchase it has been straightened out right away. Amazon video allows my family and I to watch very good movies and shows. Amazon also has kindle, so you get offers for free e-books.",5,1
One thing I would really love to see on this app is a filter in orders so that you can filter out when something is still pending delivery from the orders list. Would really help when having a large order. :),5,1
Shipping timeframe changes after purchase! I bought items that said to be delivered today between a-a. Now its tomorrow by pm. This isnt the first time this has happened. Very frustrating when you ordered toilet paper. I have Prime and met the minimun dollar amount and ordered within their timeframe for the shipment to be here on time. Also the new app version is slow to load and doesnt respond very well.,2,-1
I love this app!!! I don't have a car so I do % or more of my shopping through Amazon. This way I don't have to bug someone to take me to the store.,5,1
"You can find almost anything on Amazon, but the prices aren't always better. Usually good for hard to find items.",4,1
"Always use amazon, as I work and get the best deals and offers saving money and time shopping which i hate,and I bulk buy so don't have to carry heavy bags,and queue up behind the family's with loads of shopping and screaming kids or the great unwashed coughing their lungs out.",5,1
I  Amazon always have! I'm rating it a third ⭐⭐⭐ because I purchased an item that was very expensive$$$ and I got something that was the total opposite and cheap of what I was supposed to get . It wasn't an Amazon product it was another seller on Amazon. From here on out I will not purchase anything other than Amazon products! Other than that everything is wonderful I've never had an issue. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,3,1
"I'm inlove with Amazon,they never fail me and I've never had any issues with them and I'm going to continue being a loyal customer!",5,1
I hate the new app design. It's slower and they have completely changed the app layout.,1,-1
they don't follow delivery instructions multiple deliveries destroyed or mArked delivered and not delivered to my address or left on the street or on top of trash can on trash day etc... or thrown at my dogs etc... some expensive never got delivered and Amazon refunded to return the money worst overall customer service ever!,1,-1
I'm having a hard time ordering my stuff and getting it delivered. Hopefully this problem gets resolved soon.,3,1
Love this app every think you can think of buying is on this app a lot of the time I'll receive items the same day. You can control your Amazon account on it and all the Amazon services. You can also use Alexa to help you browse items. You can track your purchases and they will even leave a picture of your items place where it was delivered in the app. If you need to make a quick purchase or even a shopping list this is the app for you.,5,1
I have been a customer for some years and I just love ordering from here.. my husband and I have our own personal wish list for when special occasions come some we never go wrong with the wrong gifts,5,1
my amazon account had been hack many times so i need to delete my account.but before that i emailed them regarding the matter but they can't do anything.and now i made another account and order an item online.but i had to return it because they delivered diff item.they gave me the refund of the item only.but i paid the shipping fee so they should include it in the refund.,2,-1
Love the app.when you are out you can use it to compare items. So easy to use too. One of best apps out.,5,1
"Amazon. Please, check the app. It's slow and glitches. I don't know if I'm the only one with this problem but when I open the app it takes my wifi off and goes into my g mobile data. What's up with that? It's only when I use this app my wifi disappears.",2,-1
Pre update speed set the bar and post update speed has me driving  min to the store to purchase because it's less frustrating than waiting and reloading pages in the now sub par amazon app,2,-1
"Always satisfied with Amazon orders, not at all with other sellers selling the same product on Amazon. Don't buy from other sellers!",5,1
App down. Just shows a dog (you can't trick us into thinking this will lessen the frustration).,1,-1
Absolutely love the variety of products available and the price and ease of ordering are phenomenal. This app is a daily feature for me.,5,1
Stupid app keeps holding my packages hostage because their app keeps forgetting how to connect to their hub boxes and customer service's only advice is that I'll get a refund when I don't pick up my package like I just wanted to come look at their box rather than receiving what I paid for,1,-1
"Thought it wasvjust me, but reading the other reviews it seems everyone has problems. Since update // the app keeps freezing. I constantly get errors something went wrong. The app overall is now slow and just directs you to home page. I've lost the Smile option to support my charity. I can't even find where/if I can uninstall the update as it was running perfectly before. So frustrated with it.",2,-1
Up until a few weeks ago the app worked great. Still works great for searching and placing orders but now the view order screen either never loads or shows a picture of a dog and says uh-oh something went wrong - go to home page. Tried asking for help through chat and was told to log out and log back in. Hah! There's no way TO log out. Please help if you've resolved same problems.,2,-1
"I am getting sick and tired of amazon constantly changing the user interface for its app. Every single time i have to go on a hunt to find out where now the designers have hidden the manage subscriptions menu. Change for the sake of change causes more harm than good. Each time there is an interface change i dont see any positives. Clients have to relearn the location of all the menus all over again? Seriously, what is amazon doing? Is this a game? What value is amazon trying to bring?",1,-1
"The disign work perfectly. However product payment is the worst cos everything has to be connected on your name to work perfectly, like your using other card to purchase on your account it does not allow the payment to happend cos your card has to be connected on the same name you use on amazon account.",3,-1
"Easy, provides convenience and a variety of options on what you're looking for.",5,1
Past Orders fail to load. Always something wrong on Amazon's end... getting tired of it.,1,-1
I love Amazon! All My orders have been correct and on time. keep up the good work.,5,1
its the best way to get almost anything. things i know i want and can't find anywhere else. I go look and  times out of  Amazon has it.,5,1
"I love the experience of shopping with Amazon. You can find anything you need from with a wide selection of products at a price to suit anyone's pocket, and get them delivered to your door, or if it is a gift for someone it can be sent direct to them. ",5,1
"Its been very frustrating to have live streams pop up on the home screen of the app. Pointless and its easy to accidentally select that or the ""this or that"" while you're scrolling. Its made it super annoying to use the app. Have started to just use the web version on a computer because the experience on mobile is just going downhill.",1,-1
Very rarely have any problems with the app. It's responsive and clean. Thank you Amazon for a great app and your great service!,5,1
"The app in the last month or so has got worse, nothing loads up, it constantly crashes etc The app was fine as it is, you don't need to update it with new layouts etc IF IT AINT BROKE DONT FIX IT.",1,-1
This new update crashes consistently when I do searching products and tried to look at my orders also. Please fix this asap.,1,-1
"The ""Orders"" review option to see past purchases has been broke for months now. % of the time it will go to a ""oops, something went wrong"" page. It's really, really annoying. How about fixing it and making it usable again.",3,1
" Amazon is the best idea. Prime is so convenient and cheap thank you to all the hard working delivery drivers and warehouse workers, I appreciate you!!",5,1
Amazon continues to get better and better. Now with same day delivery and ability to choose preferred delivery times. Amazon=Amazing!,5,1
"where did all the search options go? can't filter anything, seems limited to searching very specifically or you have to look through everything. very poor usability in the app",1,-1
I pay for Amazon prime because of the benefits listed! Telling customers to chat with support but instead of solving a problem they make it worse! Spoke to an agent on the chat I explained the issue and instead of cancelling the product the idiot cancelled the whole order how stupid! Amazon showing delivery times as next day but once the order goes through the delivery time changes! Doing false advertisement and promises to get sales is ridiculous! Seriously contemplating to cancel my membership,2,-1
"Besides having to accounts and getting charged twice for the same service once, I love Amazon and the products they deliver. From the wishlists, to besides whatever you can basically think of prices are usually pretty fair and shipping just gets better and better #LovePrimeAllTheTime ",4,1
Don't bother ordering groceries or bottled water with them. They gonna bring u every item ordered separately multiple times per day on multiple days in a row. Amazon UAE is horrible organized compared to other countries!,1,-1
Even when a subscription for cat food has been discontinued they continue to send and make you pay for. $.. My cat can't eat it. It makes her sick.,3,1
Ordering from the Amazon app is easy. Window shopping on the app is fun. I like it.,5,1
Now there is an annoying floaty button for Alexa on this app. Why does Amazon keep nagging and trying to get people to use Alexa? Probably to steal personal data or something. Either way some of us dont like talking to our phones and prefer to just tap. So stop trying to get people to use it. If people want to use it fine. But why the obnoxious button that is not in line with the rest of the interface?,3,-1
I love being able to have heavy items shipped directly to my door. I don't have to lug heavy items from the car to the house! Free shipping is by far the best perk of Amazon Prime!!!,5,1
This five-star review is for Amazon products. I appreciate Amazon's endorsed products. I have had too many problems with non-endorsed where the seller does not stand behind Amazon return policy or the quality and integrity of what is being sold. ( items misrepresented as genuine when they are not),5,1
"Most of thecirens Ive purchased have had major issues, there is clearly no verification of the sellers. My hose kinks and byrsts and I cant contact the seller, my ceiling retractable fan stopped working and i had to foot the bill to replace the part because yet again I cant contact the seller. All of these purchases were made on my son's Donnells account but they are my purchases. So disappointed in this app",1,-1
Easy access. Website easy to follow. Was able to find what I wanted and was able to purchase without any issue.,5,1
Sometimes it's hard to navigate between the fresh grocery and getting back to the Amazon grocery side,4,1
"Love shopping Amazon. Selection of products is outstanding. I have never had a problem. I would highly recommend this site for your shopping needs. They have everything you want. Thanks to all the Amazon staff, you do a great job! ",5,1
"Everything is easy shopping with Amazon. Ordering, help  hrs customer service, customer reviews & videos, even returns. They stand behind what they sell.",5,1
"if you dont already know what amazon is then try it out for yourself and see, most packages get delivered and on time but some will not be in time or delivered at all. just take the bad with a pinch of salt and you'll see it's a great place to find what you need",5,1
"Love Amazon but not this app. Awful app. Loaded with unwanted recommendations aka ADVERTISING. Sorting of order history doesn't allow user preference, dumb. App's Push Notification of shipment and tracking is excellent. Have been Amazon customer since it started. App was five star, now only one, even less than one. Outside of app, email notification of shipping gives no details, and requires login, dumber than dumb. Not user friendly. Serves Amazon but not the user.",1,-1
"The app was working great, but the app keeps changing to Spanish. Online help states that it is an issue with the browser settings, but I've confirmed multiple times my settings are set to US English, and I have updated my Amazon settings multiple times to be set to English.",3,1
I love this app but I wish it were easier to contact seller prior to purchasing an item. I have had to make several returns due to misunderstandings between the item described and the item sent. I love the PRIME - day deliveries as well as same day items. It's very convenient! Thank you!,4,-1
"Most of there Idems are worth the price. I Paid for them,some are not.But Amazon is a great Company to buy from . Thanks an have a great evening.",5,1
easy app to use. wish shipping was faster on some products. But understand other shops sell on Amazon. Amazon ships quickly. just a side gripe lol. But the application is easy to use. Thank you.,4,1
"The app lets me keep track of my various activities on Amazon, and has almost instant updates as to deliveries and how packages are moving. I really like it!",5,1
"I love shopping with Amazon, they have cheaper prices than the stores sometimes and they are fair when it comes to a problem. Amazon is great.",5,1
"Easy to use, easy to save items for later. Great place to find great deals ",5,1
Lately the app keeps encountering errors where I see a screen that simply says 'uh oh something went wrong'.,4,1
"On multiple occasions, app updates broke Amazon Hub Locker functionality, preventing me from picking up packages. Called phone support, who confirmed it was a bug with latest software update and provided me a workaround, which involved reconfiguring my Bluetooth/NFC app permissions. Happened another time and phone support told me to reboot my phone and uninstall/reinstall the app. Pretty inconvenient to do that each time I have to pick up a package. I have a Pixel  running Android .",2,-1
"Hundreds of dollars over priced, they say free shipping but add $ to the price of the item, then trick you into believing it free shipping. AMAZON IS AN OVERPRICED JOKE!!",1,-1
I can always find everything I need on the app. It's easy to use and just brilliant to track orders and manage my account.,5,1
"Absolutely love Amazon, since becoming disabled this app has made my shopping easier and less stressful. Really easy to navigate, and the daily treasure truck has allowed me to save so much more money. And now that there's an Amazon warehouse close by, I now get same day or next day shipping. Customer service is always courteous and on point. I couldn't be happier",5,1
I love Amazon shopping it's so convenient & prices are sometimes better than the store's but sometimes the prices are higher it's according which vendor or business you shop with through Amazon but I truthful love Amazon,5,1
I've been a member for several years and never had a problem. Customer service is very helpful and prompt with solving problems. Thanks Amazon,5,1
"USPS delivery is one of the worst ideas Amazon ever had. Some of the problems I have had just recently include: - dropping (literally) packages on my front porch. - not delivering packages but reporting them as delivered. - delivering packages  to  days after the promised date from Amazon. Once they failed to deliver a package, but they reported it as delivered and took a picture of my mailbox as ""proof"" of delivery. I received the package  days later. Why am I paying for Prime delivery?",1,-1
I love shopping with Amazon but I updated my app the day before yesterday and now it keeps telling me to try again I can't even shop because it's showing me the same items over and over again very irritating please fix the issue asap I'm paying for this service every month so I need this fixed.,5,1
Love ordering from them but half the time you got to have patience on shipping so I don't order often from Amazon but still excellent prices so definitely worth waiting,4,1
My experiences has been have been absolutely perfect. I think this is the best company that I have ever in my  years dealt with and I thank you.!,5,1
Doesn't state where the items are made. Most things are from China & I haven't heard  truth from them. I'd rather pay more from free countries.,2,-1
"For dog lovers. At one time it was a convenient alternative to using Amazon's website. But in the past few months it has become a site for pictures of various dog breeds looking sad and with an accompanying message saying the app is not working and to go to Amazon Home. This happens for me at least  days a month - today as well, even after the app had just updated. Prepare to be frustrated.",2,-1
I already have an account but no longer have access to the number used for  step verification but my password works and when I tried to set up a different account with my other number from a different carrier I get message that there's already an account set up with that number(by whom?! & what email address?!) and get a completely blank customer service page.,2,-1
"Great in all ways. Easy and convenient, an all around pleasure to use. It gives life meaning.",5,1
Great app to find any and everything you need. Fast delivery service. Reviews and description of products helps a lot with shopping.,5,1
It would be nice if I could read my app for some reason it switched to a foreign language and now I can't order from Amazon because I don't speak the language of the app,1,-1
I've rarely had any issues with this app & have used it for years. I've added the update so hopefully it's as,5,1
App works mostly as expected. There's no way to view your full order history through the app though which is strange and annoying to me.,3,-1
Nice to have Amazon right at your fingertips. Simple and effective app.,5,1
The app is all messed up even after  updates I keep getting sorry this page has an error click here to return home can't even open my profile,1,-1
"sure let's keep introducing new functions when Amazon can't even maintain and fix basic functions. can't purchase digital music on the app, and searching for digital music is absolutely cancerous. new update? STILL CANT PURCHASE MPs!  AMAZON",1,-1
"Delivery notes can be removed to streamline app and save us time since drivers don't read them, Alexa sux, tracking doesn't update sometimes, vehicle info convenient for finding parts, reviews are troll, slow, refreshes and makes you lose your place",1,-1
"I have had several  star purchases thru amazon, but the one star event today, is in reference to a Amazon policy concerning reviews. Amazon will not let you post any negative comment in regards to a vender. They kick it back. My issue was I paid for expedited shipping, and in the past my purchase came by the date listed at check out. in this case it came to late and i had to buy one. My point is we should be able to tell others about poor vender performance.",1,-1
"Confusing UI, still slow, what happened?!? Dont update unless you want your experience to be more confusing",1,-1
"Slower than the previous version, unnecessarily moved the cart and hamburger menu from the top of the screen to the bottom and more... for no apparent reason. When will project managers learn to keep what's good and quit changing things just for the sake of change? I used to really like the app. The most recent version is just one more reason to shop elsewhere.",2,-1
It can be the confusing with all the different cards and it is difficult to get some return as I live in a rural town I would like a maybe a prepaid to send back things so I don't give them away because I am don't have much in life but I do appreciate Amazon and I like many of things on here for my family and I am grateful to GOD,4,1
"The app has been helpful for Convenience of shopping, quick delivery and easy returns. I do experience issue with glitches and resistance when scrolling through my wish list sometimes, I hope that gets fixed because it only started about  months ago or that's when I noticed it. overall, amazing app.",4,-1
The App works fine but every month or so it logs me out. My wife and I share an account so it is just I convenient to be signed out automatically and her have to confirm me getting back in,3,-1
Cannot fault Amazon. I've been a Prime member for many years and have gotten many benefits for those years for a very small fee. Items are very reasonably priced and the free next day delivery is unbeatable.,5,1
Great customer service and lowest prices % of the time. But have to remove  star because the app lacks dark mode option.,4,1
"With the latest update, now an ANNOYING Alexa bubble appears in right middle screen when browsing products. I want to see the product, not the obnoxious blue bubble that I WILL NEVER USE.",2,-1
"They just added an annoying floating Alexa bubble on top of the content. It won't go away, even if you have Alexa turned off, and if you accidentally touch it, it interrupts your shopping and tries to get you to turn Alexa on.",3,-1
"Tired of all the damn dogs everytime (especially now constantly) when the app screws up, it even says I'm logged out but then says my name afterwards so I'm not logged out, remove the dogs and replace with bezos falling out his rocket while falling back to earth, or his ex-wife pushing him out.",2,-1
Claims to be a multibillion dollar e-commerce platform. Can't figure out I want to pay for something with a card I just added OBVIOUSLY. Doesn't send a notification. I missed a shipping cutoff. I cancelled the order and won't be ordering it through them. Useless. Obvious and obnoxious fault in your ordering system. You will continue to lose my money until it's fixed. Why offer  day shipping if you can't even get your ordering and payment system together. Why Amazon. WHY?,1,-1
"Delivery drivers drop off packages at the wrong address without reading specific delivery instructions. Despite having a Prime membership, my packages are constantly delayed (one day shipping my a**).",3,1
"Terrible. The standard seemed to have fallen. I much prefer the website as the app requires additional steps for the sinplest things. The app is also slow, products don't load, images aren't showing, and it's no longer simple.",2,-1
The best experience buying online. Never has problems with it. always in time.,5,1
great way to shop for just about everything. fast and easy check out options including ebt purchases for when you move across the country and nobody carries your brand.,5,1
"I love Amazon & have been a frequent shopper for years now. There's an enormous amount of different options/products, with prices ranging depending on what you can afford. That's one of the best parts for me! You can find the same high dollar item for less & not compromise on the quality of the item. I recommend to all my friends & family! Amazing customer service & delivery drivers! Quite possibly the BEST! *'s",5,1
"This app need fixing,i bought an item but when i recieve an email n went to manage the order put my email and password it said the password is incorrect.I have unistalled it.I even sign in with new email but the same case,Are they serious.",1,-1
Whatever you do if you buy something don't try to return it more than twice because they close my account and said that I surpass their a to z policy and they couldn't help me at that rate. So they told me to create another account under another email which they close. That account spent over hundreds and hundreds of dollars on prime video movies and they closed out the account and did it again and tried to take money from my debit cards when I didn't owe money. They are being very shady!!!!!!!,1,-1
"It's so easy to find what I'm looking for, look at reviews and the purchase process is so streamlined and easy. I am a loyal Amazon customer for life!",5,1
"So much choice. Great prices. Sometimes returns options are limited, but most sellers and Amazon are generally great at offering flexibility. Be wary of the default being to add a delivery charge for fast delivery and never ending offers of Prime!",4,-1
"App clearly does what ever it wants to do, even if you use the filter correctly. Inventory is never updated with the actual website. You get different search in the app, compared to your web browser. I use the app strictly for notifications. That's it.",1,-1
Useless help in chat function. I heard they sticky tape rodents to smartphones to reply to requests for help. They made to mash out a few words but it's complete nonsense.,1,-1
"Amazon have everything you could possibly want or need. orders arrive quickly, well packaged, in excellent condition. My number one go to for safe shopping ",5,1
"I never have any issues with shopping on Amazon until recently. I had two packages delivered but only one package came to my door but both showed delivered. Three days later management at my Complex let me know they had it. It's odd that they had the same time stamp and came on different vans. However, this was unusual and I always have received the best service and no issues otherwise. Must say the tracking is impeccable.",5,1
"Amazon shopping has some features that the online website doesn't have it's the only way to contact live customer service chat. It loads pages faster than the website, but doesn't have some other features like the website does. It's a good addition to the online website, but the use of the website is still needed to view easier to read product pages.",4,-1
"I love doing business with Amazon everything is always perfect exactly what I ordered and shipping is amazing fastest ever, prices are unbeatable, anything you can think of I'm pretty sure you'll find it in Amazon, they're the best online shopping experience I'd recommend.",5,1
"So, I have loved Amazon since . Not anymore. On Sunday - I logged into Amazon and found out that my account was blocked from making reviews for ""unusual activity."" I have proceeded to connect customer service  times.  by chat once by calling. They each promise hr response. But it's been  hours since the first contact. I've also emailed three times. Nothing. I'm highly disappointed in Amazon, they deleted every review from  to now with no warning and refuse to tell me why.",1,-1
"Not sure why they changed the app, but the newest version is slow, sluggish and poor. Bravo developers",1,-1
"Use to love this app. I became addicted to shopping on Amazon when the virus hit and had  or  orders daily. And the app was great. But the last month or so ghe last update made it un usable fir some things. It won't go to ""your orders "" and just keeps refreshing every half seconds. So it never gets a chance to load. Sometimes it will act as u have no internet even though you're connected to wifi which is working. Last sometimes won't let you change address until u quit the app and restart it.",3,-1
the ads are very deceiving. when they have multi items and one generic description. I do trust any of your sellers.,1,-1
as my health declines I find myself unable to physically go to a mortar brick store to shop. the only site I trust is Amazon. I can attest to buy everything from my clothes and my toiletries and my bedding and all my electronics TVs laptops cell phones all come from Amazon. in my opinion they have the best customer service out of any company I've dealt with for anything. whenever I have a problem which is fairly infrequently they always make sure I'm happy before they hang up.,5,1
Every single time I order these hefty foam plates  count from any seller they say my package was delivered and I never received it is there something with this item because this is the only item I've been having problems with for months,1,-1
"Very bad experience with no commitment for delivery times, and had to finally cancel my order for not able to delivery and useless customer service phone call, and finally waiting for my money to be return !!!! Does not worth wasting time and effort !!!!",1,-1
"Really slow and clunky now. Keeps freezing. Update: I now can't even buy anything. Will delete, useless.",1,-1
I love Amazon!!! it's the best!! you can find things you can't find in the stores.returns are extremely easy! A++!!!,5,1
"Search is a nightmare. Every search shows different results too. Even if you post the truth it goes against the ""guidelines"". Disappointed I wasted all my time reviewing stuff yet to just get deleted. I do post within the guidelines yet I can't post! Yet they want my opinion for other things. Sellers price gouging. Some stores you click on the custom item and goes right back to your last custom.  Add something it goes straight to the cart. ",1,-1
"After the last update changing the country is so difficult, I can't switch countries like before.",2,-1
"Slow loading hurts a lot, especially when seeing my orders to track the delivery person (I need this often when I order groceries). Please optimize the app and make driver tracking more accessible (like adding a delivery estimate for the current order in the home screen itself, similar to what ride sharing apps do)",4,-1
Fix locker hub problems can't send to locker hubs says need to use smart phone and have Amazon shopper app hmm I have both AND STILL CANT DO IT and I send feedback email I get email we will consider your opinion not we will get back to you or we are sorry (auto generated emails) nope we will consider your opinion so they don't care at all about the customers. Sadly that's what happens when a company gets to big for its britches,1,-1
Giving it  stars because it always tries to trick me into buying a whole month membership. It says it'll remind me  days before my trial ends so I can cancel yet it never does. This has happened many times. Amazon is money hungry af.,2,-1
Ridiculously SLOW!!!!! Since a few months ago that the app upgraded to a new style it is totally USELESS!!! Dreadful shopping experience !,1,-1
most items i buy worth it.. some items don't add up but Amazon also makes it right to always willing to help out.. that is nice.. i'm disappointed in way how the music works now then previous..,5,1
"It used to work perfectly fine, but now I can't see my orders. Every time I attempt to see them, the app goes into an infinite loop reloading. The cart from time to time is also buggy and wouldn't show up.",1,-1
"Buggy these days. Every time I open the app, directly or via a link, I see a blank screen until I tap my device back button (weird and annoying) and often the prices of items is shown in a distorted way which misses the '.' £. item appear to be £. Easily fixed, surely? Using a galaxy note  ultra.",3,-1
"I wish it would tell the subtotal in each ""Your List"" I have to add them to my cart just to find the price then add them back to my list. Also, it would be great if you could add the option ""Add to list"" to the right of all the items that you search for instead of clicking on a certain item from your search and scrolling down to find ""Add to list"" Overall, awesome!!!",5,1
"My Amazon Shopping App has been glitching lately. My cart is actually empty, but Its currently showing I have  items in my cart at the bottom, but yet states up at the top of the app that my cart is empty. When I select an item to put in the cart, I go to the cart and its not there. Im having to select it several times to see it, only to see I have selected it in multiple quanities. Having to be careful that I am not purchasing more items than I actually want. Fix this, please.",2,-1
Really annoying. Amazon holds my account for no reason and doesn't give my account back!!!!!!! Amazon fix this up!!!,1,-1
love Amazon! awesome service and very fast. everything I need they have and no lines to stand in or covid!,5,1
i find it interesting and fun better then going to stores and shopping but i fear this will be our shopping ways from now on anyways i enjoy browsing the site so i know what to look for next an it keeps track of my tab which I once an a while hate lol,5,1
"Ahhh what can i say?! Amazon is like any other multi billion dollar conglomerate; the more money they have the less important we(the consumers) are. Got an issue? You either get to chat with a useless chat bot or if you do manage to get through to a human, x out of  its outsourced and then you get to experience the joy of conflict resolution with a language barrier, that is, if you are somehow able to get someone to deviate from their script and actually listen to you. Good luck!",1,-1
"I'd say it works perfectly and have never had a problem with the app itslef, Amazon on the other hand has its areas of improvement but overall they do a great job .",5,1
"prices changed once i checked out, its very bad customer service to list prices in gbp on an EU site than amend them blaming on the currency exchange, just simply very bad practice and will not encourage me to visit the eu site as often as i ordered in uk.",1,-1
"Quick and easy to use. I find almost every I need. I shop and compare prices, make wish lists for myself and can access my grandkids lists. Ships quick and as a prime member, zero shipping.",5,1
A blank page regularly appears when you are looking at an item and your item vanishes. You then have to scroll back. Very frustrating.,1,-1
"Love the next day delivery with prime, but it's great even without it if you don't mind paying postage on some things.",5,1
The price is not always the lowest compared to other sites. But the on-time/ fast delivery makes up for it.,4,-1
"Everything is great no problem until the past week, I order something it says it was shipped & is at Amazon facility then it goes back to not shipped yet & it's no longer giving me the map that tells me its  stops away. People steal packages in my building so I defended on that map. Please fix this",4,-1
Don't get this unless you want your money taken. It randomly charged me $ a month and took over  dollars for faster shipping that I didn't sign up for.,1,-1
"so easy and convenient to use and love all that get with my prime membership including all the movies, shows and music its a no brainer",5,1
Amazing... Pretty much you can find anything. Super fast delivery and easy return. Much better than other online shopping experience. Highly recommended!!,5,1
"Great selection, reasonable prices and quick delivery, is coupled with, outstanding customer service and worry free return policy. That's what make Amazon my go to shopping place for over a decade.",5,1
"HORRIBLE & DISAPPOINTING! If you are a user of Amazon for so long & trusted them & give all your card details, please do not! I have received an SMS yesterday from my bank saying that I got deducted from subscribing Amazon Prime which I never opted to use! It happen when I was on work and I cannot focus thinking that somebody tried to STEAL money from my account! What if I did not saw it & did not cancel immediately? Customer service needs to be trained PROPERLY, doesn't know the word EMPATHY",1,-1
I think it should explain somewhere how to put the shortcut on your homepage... I reread and reread all the material at least  times and if it's in there somewhere I'm a stupid person!!!,3,-1
"It's directing me to amazon.sa with no confirmation from me . I don't shop with amazon.sa cause they have a bad collections and quality . I have an account on earlier update of this app . When i tried to sign in , My lists , orders and my history has disappeared . I can use my favorite update on older device . But i need to use it on my new phone . PLEASE fix that issue :(",1,-1
"It keeps on saying to update my payment method even when I have money in my card. No matter the card, it keeps on saying that. This has been going on for days now and it's annoying.",2,-1

Amazon is so easy to use and affordable. Great customer service and easy returns . I know I can find anything I want on Amazon and I hardly an ever disappointed .,5,1
"The newest update made all my previous orders disappear, all of my favourites lists, everything I previously had in my cart. I'm so disappointed and frustrated. It's like I'm starting from scratch again.",1,-1
Dependable smooth operation. Reliable service and easy to select from their vast range of nearly everything!,5,1
"Hijacks browser links and then gives less value than the website. Doesn't distinguish between important notifications and trashy spam notifications, of which there are a lot. Not sure why I keep it installed, but I'm inching closer to removing it.",2,-1

"I had just gotten a ten dollar gift card for Amazon and decided to make an account just to use the gift card and buy something for myself. I put the code in and went to purchase the item I wanted. But when I was going to purchase it I clicked continue and it told me please enter your payment information, even though the box that says use your gift card balance is highlighted and it still won't let me purchase what I want. I do not know what is happening but I am pretty damn Infuriated.",1,-1
Love it when it works but it keeps signing me out. It does this every few months but it says I don't have amazon unlimited even though we pay for it,2,-1
"Latest update REMOVED giving delivery instructions? And grading drivers? At least that's what I'm seeing here. Repeal the newest update, what happened to customers first? On the first day of this change, my delivery guy (Amazon delivery), lied and stated they handed package to resident. LIED! Drivers are gonna start taking advantage of this change. And no photos of delivery, very nice AMAZON! YOUR Best feature. Removed overnight? I QUIT AMAZON, back to ebay!",1,-1
"I downloaded Amazon app store to leverage a discount for in-game purchases.  times now my account has been locked and I am unable to make any purchases. This app may not be worth the % savings for % headache, inconvenience, and multiple calls to customer service. You decide.",2,-1
It would be nice if at least English was universally present in every country I am using the app. Instead in Poland I have to go back and forth from Google Translate to do even the smallest things.,3,1
"After the past several updates, going to my orders page just shows up blank. Once in a while, it will show my orders, but usually nothing. I have the business app too, and it works just fine there. This is extremely annoying.",2,-1
"I really love the convenience, fast shipping and outstanding customer support/ service that Amazon provides... thanks!!!",5,1
"I order almost everything on this majestic app. Amazon is The way to go when it comes to order stuff and getting your packages on time, and they always email you when before and after it arrives. ""Best App Ever""",5,1
"as far as amazon goes, the sight is easy and prices are competitive. It's great. just be careful of some of the items. I have ordered items stating things like ""sturdy"" or ""built well"" and been disappointed. However, Amazon does It's best to rectify almost all issues so far.",5,1
My only thing is can you make there a way to put it in dark mode  it burns my eyes with the white background it's just too bright other wise pretty good app.,4,-1
Service is great! Any issues I've ever had always get addressed and taken care of in a timely manner. But the fact that I can get something delivered within a day is why I always shop Amazon.,5,1
"As with other reviewers, the app on my Android device inexplicably switched to Spanish. Since no one else has access to the device, and I neither read nor speak the language, this is incredibly annoying.",1,-1
I don't know how scams is possible in UAE. I orderd online for scientific calculator but I received different model. When I campare price found alot of difference. So don't use Amazon first and last experience. Bye bye Amazon,1,-1
it used to show you a very long list of results for your searches. I'm really tired of the  results per page where  are advertisements and  don't really match what you searched for. I hate this app...,1,-1

Uups - someting went wrong!!! The constant message on this app!!!!! It simply does not work after updates installed. Checking a status of your package is impossible.,1,-1
"Sucks. Freezes constantly, takes forever to load after recent updates, and is a massive pain to use. Going to start buying directly from merchants to avoid using Amazon",1,-1
Cart button still broken. half the time it takes me to a random product and I cannot access my cart at all. This has been a problem for a year now,2,-1
I purchased this steering stabilizer as a gift. However it ended up being that the  Jeep Wrangler YJ has a custom front end and the product did not fit. I returned it to Amazon from a Kohl's location. Was contacted later by Amazon saying that Rough Country received a different item than what they sent us and recharged us. The item that was returned was the item that came in the Box. I'm an honest person and because the company has dishonest people I get stolen from.,1,-1
"Since I change my phone to S Ultra I constantly get a blank/white screen when I am trying to open up the app. I have to shut down the app and restart the app to be able to access the app. I have tried restarting phone, uninstall/reinstall app nothing worked so far. Please upgrade/update the app. Thanks!",2,-1
you want everything automate. if you do not want to pay for assistance when ever some one buy something give the the email of saler to get a hold for examples I order a bed and one of the pieces was broken I just need it that pieces i did not want to return the whole think because it took me several months to get and shipping is expensive and I already had assemble so what can I do to get that part nothing because I can not get a hold of customers service,4,-1
I love Amazon. Shipping is fast and you can get the items at your door when you need the item. The one thing I don't like is I have to go so far to send an item back. Otherwise Amazon is great,5,1
"The app is broken after an update. Any search ends up with a message showing ""something went wrong on our end"" and return to homepage. Clicking on return to homepage doesn't bring you back to anywhere either. Please fix it.",1,-1

"CROOKS! I cancelled my prime, which was supposed to be about  bucks a month and include everything, I originally got it for music. After reading horrible racist things from the Washington Post, I decided I needed to cancel my subscription, and they tried to charge me over  bucks just for music in some weird differentiation I was never made aware of but luckily saw. If I had not locked my debit card I would have been overcharged for something I did not order after blatantly trying to cancel.",1,-1
"I love shopping on Amazon, they have everything at a great price & delivery service is quick & easy. LOVE IT️️️",5,1
I'm very happy with my experience in your Amazon shopping app anytime I've had a discrepancy or had to return something they've always been extremely helpful and the returns have always been easy I'm very happy to keep using this app to continue to buy my products I don't think you can go wrong especially if you are over  and have what it takes to get to $. per month it's a great benefit especially if you only need one or two items that are just a few dollars well worth it,5,1
Twilight beauty... everything and more. For me i leave this comment for any curious ears. Thanks so far its been eye opening all the technologies. I Am the best at speaking truths,5,1
"A rather fickle app which tends to have a hard time with proper refunds on unrecieved items, incorrectly remembered ""previous purchases"" or even poor cross examination on items put on the stores catalog. Back in it's hay day, such issues weren't as prevalent, but to today, it is still quite messy.",2,-1
It is great being able to shop in the off hours. Shopping prime items I always get great service and delivery on time.,5,1
"app has a lot of glitches and for them upping the membership fees I feel like the experience should be better, but I just always have issues. I'm really at the point where I want to cancel and just drive myself to the store or order from another site.",1,-1
Generally very easy and intuitive to use. No obvious flaws or issues experienced during use.,4,-1
Very bad experience Amazon you are a thief you steal money from people when they cancel the order is your automatically stop any future charges of the debitors account but no you guys don't you automatically charge their account even though the item is canceled you're a thief I would highly recommend this company to be shut down,1,-1
Amazon is the best shopping app I've ever used. I can fine and buy almost anything at a good price.,5,1
"my items were to arrive tomorrow. after ordering the date changed to Monday, lucky I caught thr order to cancel it a place a new order. one item still will not arrive tomorrow.",3,1
"No offense to Spanish speaking people but my app has switched to Spanish I can neither read not speak Spanish, I didn't do any changes in my settings, because of that when I am interested in buying something I am not able to read the details and description of the product, I just get frustrated and leave the page this happens even when I am not using the app too",1,-1
Amazon store! I like shopping at Amazon store because my products I order there's no damages when I open my package when it arrives. and get good service and I find what I'm looking for I recommend shopping at Amazon store ️ *****'s,5,1
I take issue with not being able to control which push notifications come through to my phone. I WANT to know when a pavkage has arrived. I DO NOT WANT ANY notifications about what your stupid algorithm thinks I might want to buy. Do not advertise to my push notifications and not let me turn that off without losing security functionality.,1,-1
App is not working correctly when I try to place an Amazon fresh order with my Samsung v fold. I have to dig out my old LG phone to place an order. Kind of sucks...a lot. Customer service was no help and kept telling me to use a different device and that they were having known issues and try again later. I have had this issue for over  months.,1,-1
"excellent on delivering to hub lockers,you should have more and also for large items, love shopping on Amazon,great on returns,you make it happy doing shopping with Amazon. great job.",5,1
"Prime isn't what is used to be. Nothing is ever available, and all my orders keep showing up late for no discernible reason. And when packages do show up, the delivery person puts it in the mailbox and not on the porch like I specified. Whatever they did with this recent update, they need to fix it.",3,-1
"I loved the app until recently. When I started playing Reggaeton music in the Amazon Music app, my Prime app switched everything to Spanish. Weird right? Customer service explained how to change the settings. It now alternates between Spanish and an English/Spanish hybrid. I imagine it's some sort of Artificial Intelligence bias, but that doesn't help when all I want to do is place a quick order and move on.",3,1
So I'm being charged by Amazon prime when I have a free account because of the promotion that came with my phone when I got it and now all of a sudden they are trying to charge me money for Amazon prime when I have a free account I will be taking this to court and starting my lawsuit as soon as possible thank you very much.,1,-1

Many times when you search a specific item , results show Everything But , then I usualy stumble upon it later. However its pretty handy , and we use it alot. We still havent taken advantage of the many things available with Prime , but plan to once all figured out. The wife will use those more than me probably. Try it out.",4,-1
"I had  complaints about the app, and I loved how efficient and organized it made bookmarking and purchasing. However, the most recent update has rendered the app useless, leaving it entirely translated in Spanish ( for reasons unknown ) - which I don't speak. ",3,1
"This app has its goods and bads. While the app isn't terrible in terms of finding what you want, it doesn't like to cancel orders. Instead, it will allow the order through, then you have to return the item instead to get your money back. I know it may or may not be on the companies end, where the product is coming from, but it's still inconvenient.",4,-1
"App has become glitchy in the past couple of months. I can rarely bring up my orders on the app. This limits being able to track orders, re-purchase items and handle returns. I have to use a computer for these actions. It is quite annoying. I initially wrote this post in Feb. . Its noq May  and nothing has changed. Fix the app!!",1,-1
Better than Walmart. It has the best deals. Walmart says every day low price why? It is LITERALLY false because it's high prices and because they want more money Amazon is way way WAY better,5,1
"Most of the app is decent. However, searches are horrific. If you search for ""computer desk"", you might get computers and school desks.",3,-1
The app overall is great. The one star is because I can no longer rent or buy digital content at all on an Android platform. Absolutely ridiculous!!,1,-1
Broken. Cannot search anything after the last update. It just shows up white and never loads.,1,-1
"very easy to use and search for things. the shipping is typically on time, if not sooner.",5,1
"Fix your shipping! Why on earth do I pay full price for Amazon prime when they continue to use USPS?! They never ship to my place. It always goes to my post office. So I literally have to drive there to pickup my packages all the time. What's the point buying online? Do better! Until then, I'll buy most of my stuff elsewhere.",1,-1
Can you please fix the favourites button every time we selected items to favourite It doesn't go to the favourite section so we try to go to your wish list section and again. It's not show up in that section so please this is for Amazon technician team fix this issue thank you. Customers always right we are number one priority with us. You can make a lot of things and with you you can become even better every day with better and better services thank you.,4,1
"Electronic shopping is crazy fun!! Especially on Amazon! It's like magic, shopping with invisible money and *poof* a day or  later the stuff arrives! I did it over and over again until they wouldn't let me anymore, because apparently all of my invisible money disappeared...",5,1
Some parts of the app simply just don't function . Sometimes the update will help briefly but then it goes right back to not working,1,-1
I enjoy shopping on Amazon there is such a wide variety of items. Also I trust ordering on Amazon versus some site from social media sites.,5,1
I have my account for +. the only reason I put four stars There's a trap do not buy Google gift card well couse to suspend all your online accounts out side of google platform even Google Gmail . if you have Auto paying it well cancel cant do nothing untell Google let u or not the credit card bureau wich there only one who can do this action in usa so Google is playing with fire lucky i fix it without paying late fees but mabe nextime may have to press legal charges.i have file saved,4,-1

And the latest in infinite wisdom we can't buy kindle ebooks on this app. We have to go to a browser & login every time. Who thinks up this Using SG+.,2,-1
Seems Amazon is loosing it's touch. I havnt been receiving some of the items I have ordered. Its getting pretty old.,2,-1
"The search engine is all but unusable. It ignores forced keywords, and excluded ones. The filters it offers you are random and not comprehensive. It is designed to take the ability to aggressively filter away from you to place more products in front of you. It is highly unrecommended to use if you are look for highly specific or graded items. Google instead. It actually listens then links to the item on Amazon.",1,-1
"I believe that Amazon has to modernize this application a little. Presently, it looks like a -to- adaptation of the website. A friendly application is slightly different. One cannot personalize the app. One cannot apply a darker theme, for instance. Thank you.",3,-1
"the only real issue i have with shopping amazon, is it is so damn difficult to return an item if you dislike it, or if it is broken. I have only had one item come broken, and I still have it because I don't know how to return it, and the manufacturers, (whom you are told to contact with issues) and they never get back to you.",3,1
Slow shipping okay prices difficult to use. Poor customer service. Don't use subscription service you're absolutely last in line to get it because I know you got you trapped with subscription and then you'll order another one and then you'll end up with way too many.,1,-1
"They need to tell users about the changes they make. For example, the wishlist is now a heart icon. If you tap it then the item goes into your default wish list. If you press and hold it then you can choose which wish list (if you have more than one) to add the item to.",4,1
I hate amazon i pay for prime and says i will recieve my products on a day and they never show up and than amazon gives my packages to ups n usps to deliver some packages and there trucks dont fit down my block so yup i never get those packages...why am i paying for prime and never get prime service...fix this,1,-1
"Shopping at Amazon is really convenient because you get to shop from home, get it delivered right to your door in a timely manner and if you are not satisfied with your purchase they have real easy hassle free returns. I highly recommend shopping with Amazon",5,1
Amazon is encouraging price gauging and bad business practices. Many times things are higher prices but customer are not aware of it. Request to publish marked price of all items.,2,-1
Im reporting Amazon because it spended $ and i did nothing so once i first dowload the app i was happy and plus my mom gave me $ bucks so she sented me  bucks bc i didnt want all the money so i was gonna order some slime but it turned out to be bad and my brother order stuff on amazon but it happend to him before AND PLUS I FORGOT THEY SPENED  BUCKS ALSO THEY BROUGHT A CARD IM SUEING YALL SO NOW I GOT $ BUCKS LEFT I KNOW YALL HAPPY WITH THAT MONEY BUT YALL WONT BE HAPPY NO MORE..heh,1,-1
"In the past  yrs. I have not had any problems. I order drones, circuit boards, and every thing for growing cannabis indoors. Grow lights, other equipment and nutrients. Every time I would choose the free delivery option  to  days. I would always get it sooner, sometimes withen  days. Thank you Amazon.",5,1
Easy to use and plenty of products to choose from that are very reasonably priced. if you can't find the item you are looking for anywhere else then Amazon will probably have it in stock,5,1
"AMAZON FIXED IT AND BROKE APP. For the last couple of years app worked great. They did an update for Android and half the time you cannot check order status via the app. You get a msessage ""problem on our end go to home page"" and some picture of some mutt. It's just the Android app. Works in Windows and IOS for iPad. It's an annoying Android problem that Amazon needs to be fix.",3,-1
I had to uninstall it do to it's capacity for any android it just takes up way too much file space in the system and my device is getting to be sticky too much and running very slow because of it. But once I uninstalled it my phone has been running a lot better.,2,-1
Since posting my last review I've learned that the add to list button is available if you restart the app a few times. Thanks to those that immediately reached out with solutions! I'm still only giving it  stars because it's a little jumpy and buggy.,3,1
"Recommend to DO NOT download! Useless. Cant resolve paid order issue for many days until now. Shipping issue created by Amazon itself. Im Amazon customer since  and seems this platform now rolling backward instead of improve service and move ahead, develop better approach to attract new customers and keep loyal ones from leaving and shifting to other platforms. Going to uninstall this app despite active paid orders which will be returned to Amazon as present from me with no refund request.",1,-1
Hard to find a company better than Amazon! I have ordered thousands of dollars in equipment and the money back if not satisfied / or defective product return is a additional bonus!,5,1
times slower than the previous version. Badly designed icon logic and placement. Things that previously could be done in one step now need mutiple steps.,1,-1
"As much as people like to complain about Amazon, the service is truly miles ahead of the competition. Free international shipping. Guaranteed quality. Easy, free returns and reimbursments when there are troubles.",5,1
"I use Amazon App mostly to organize and compare products that i need to buy for my home but recently the ""add to list"" button is complete gone so stuff has been added to my cart but the cart only holds  products regardless of cost. I could save for later but it's not organized and not easy to look at for later. Please bring back the ""Add to List"" button. Shipping and products are top notch, have never received a bad product via Amazon .",2,1
The most recent update is very slow. It takes longer to access anything that isn't a product search. The delay to access personal lists is annoying but now there's no option to add things to lists anymore. I guess they're not just getting rid of public gift lists but all lists? Very disappointed.,2,-1
"Amazon has most everything anyone could want,but, even with Prime, the dates of delivery are not always as promised, which happens quite often, now days. if you can wait on products,it's great!",4,-1
"Decent app overall, I use it rather frequently. However no matter what listing I click on, there is no ""add to wish list button"" anywhere anymore, only the options to buy now or add to cart. Very very frustrating.",2,-1
"The app is ugly and unreliable. It will randomly take items out of my cart and ""save them for later."" The design language is so incohesive it leaves my brain confused half the time. Unfortunately there's really no alternative for all purpose online shopping.",2,-1
Loved it until now. They deleted the list feature and that is so annoying. I add stuff to lists so I can purchase all at once when I do that project and now that is completely gone!! I rather go to the store and get it if I have to spend hours to look for each individual item and add it to the cart separately all at once!,1,-1
"I've always loved the app until recently. WHERE IS MY 'ADD TO LIST OPTION'?? This is a huge hassle for me! Now I have to take screenshots of everything I want so I can come back eventually to find it. Not only with items that I need, but with all of my Kindle books too. Get this fixed!!",1,-1
It freezes when I hit free shipping so I end up having to order on desktop anyway. What a waste of space on my phone.  edit: they fixed that problem but now I can't add items to my wish list so the app is still trash.,1,-1
Glitched save wish list. Not only did the new update make the list freeze you cant save to wish list either. Please fix the wish list glitch,3,1
"I can't buy kindle books through the app anymore. I could try the Kindle store that is directly on the Kindle, but that always freezes. Ridiculous. I know, it's because Google wants to tax all purchases now. Greed, as usual. Funny how Google, and Amazon for that matter keep looking more and more like Apple these days. Not sure Android/Google is worth it anymore.",1,-1
My lists are not in alphabetical order anymore. So frustrating. I'm disappointed in you Amazon. Fix it!,1,-1
Was great until the recent update removed the add to wishlist button. Incredibly inconvenient since we don't own a home computer. Will probably impact the amount we use Amazon since our entire family uses this for holidays and birthday gifts.,1,-1
"Amazon removed the add to list button on the app and through the browser on phone. When I tried to get an answer the nonchalant customer service rep stated ""if you need to add to list or create a registry you need to use a computer"" What the heck?! That's cool I need to stop shopping on the site. Thanks alot ",2,-1
"I love Amazon, have been a Prime member for a long time and the prices and customer service cannot be beat along with the selection!",5,1
"Since the most recent update I can no longer add items to my wishlist via the app. Now I have to revert back to a browser to add items, it looks like prior to the update, they tried to make it a long press to select which list to add to which would have been amazing. Hopefully it is repaired quickly so I'm not having to go back to using the browser.",3,-1
"Can't purchase on the Instant Video app, can't purchase on this app. Way to go Amazon, you're really nailing it.",1,-1
Not sure what happened about the List options of adding things to a list but I can't seem to find it anymore and it's real annoying. So fix that,3,-1
"Ever since my app updated it's been freezing, moving slow, reloading. It is so damn annoying I'm ready to uninstall",1,-1
"Why cant I add items to my wishlist anymore? There used to be a link to touch that said ""add to list"" and then your wishlists came up for you to choose which one to put it in. Now that add to list option is just poof gone. Fricken annoying. With severe ADHD I can't remember day to day what the items I liked were called or what store they were from. So putting them in lists is super helpful....and now that's gone. This app has gone down the pisser",1,-1
"Really disappointed with the coding. Shopping itself is a fairy good experience,but navigating in this app is horrendous. Trying to contact or answer seller is like trying to find a way through a maze, and when you get there you can't even type because somehow it hasn't registered in the proper category, so I can only see the question but have to wait ages so I can answer. What a let down, so much money wasted, I feel bad for normal Amazon employees deing with incompetent superiors",2,-1
"Hate the update! I can't find half the things I used to and I can no longer add items to my wish list. Try and search as I may, there is no ""add to wish list"" anywhere anytime I go into product details. Fix this please!",2,-1
"I'm very sad because I ordered some stuff from amazon and I was waiting for my parcel to arrive, and instead it was returned promising that my money will be put back in my account wich never happent... and it's second time that I have this problem with Amazon...",3,-1
"I cant even add items to my list from the app, they offered a discount for downloading and never honored it. Search shows random items instead of what I typed in.",1,-1
What the hell have your idiot developers done now?!?!? You cant add items to your list. It only gives you a registry option. Could yall please fix yet another mess you made?!?!,1,-1
"Put the old wishlist option back. The heart option DEFAULTS to your ""wishlist"" so then you have to go in and move the item to the actual wishlist you want.... Item pages could be neater. All pertinent item info should be immediately under the photo and you shouldn't have reviews at the bottom. That's sketchy business practice.",1,-1
"Terrible now that I can now no longer buy Kindle books through the app. And now I can't even add Kindle books to a wishlist, and can only add other items to my main wishlist and not a specific one.",1,-1
LOVE using Amazon and didn't have any issues until about a day ago. I can't add things to my lists anymore and the app is slower and harder to manage,3,-1
Option to add to lists has been removed - the only options available are add to registry and gifting. Please put this feature back. Tried uninstalling & reinstalling to see if it was just my app being weird but it is still missing. It's also for every item.,2,-1
"Changing my rating from  to  because I'm not able to add to my lists anymore. I've been adding to cart, then saving what I'm interested in by clicking on ""save for later"" so I won't lose the item. I'm still able to move items in my wishlist to other categories in my list (played around with that just to see something), but the link to add to list is no longer available when looking at items. The April  update messed this up. Please correct this feature. I do pay for Prime monthly.",3,-1
There are times I have to wait longer for my items than what I was told.And Amazon doesn't always update the items that are advertised until you already have bought it then wants you to pay more..Not good business practice.,3,-1
"Easy to find what I want and order at a price I like with fast delivery, what's not to like.",5,1
"This app used to be good however the app only displays in French and it is increasingly getting more difficult to navigate. While I do understand and speak French, English is my native language. I cannot even find the language option anymore. It is more than frustrating and considering Amazon had revenues of $B last year, they can do a lot better.",1,-1
Keeps telling me to revise the payment shipping over and over again and I'm getting sick of it. Everytime I buy something it does that and it pushed my shipment back  days now instead of waiting a few days I've been waiting  weeks for two items,1,-1
"If you visit a different country (from Netherlands to Spain), they will still only allow you to select either Netherlands or Belgium. Am I supposed to change my whole PlayStore settings just to order something?!",1,-1
When did Amazon turn into Wish? Everything on there is a cheap imitation now. Nothing is being done to combat fake reviews. % of the things I buy end up being returned because they're not as described.,1,-1
On multiple times items haven't arrived or I haven't got and I wanted to get a refund so I can buy the three products again and they said they would give me a full refund which would be about or around  dollars and they gave me .  dollars instead. And now I'm out of money I can't get anything for my mom for mother's day because I don't get much as a teen and when I was finally able to get her something around mother's day it didn't come and I got scammed out of like  bucks.,2,-1
Now a days Amazon is declining the reviews on the products purchased. They give some flimsy reasons for declining review. They are favouring the sellers because they give more revenue to Amazon. Amazon won't give email ID to customers to contact them. Contact is only through chat or phone which is again controlled by bots or AI. Human interface is not there. They need to improve the customer service,3,1
I constantly have shipping issues when I contact them I can never get an answer if I'm not home they leave my packages any and everywhere send me an email saying delivered then I'm like where? And of course they're like check with your neighbors no ma'am I will not go door to door looking for your mistakes. Today the driver turned off the alerts I was  stops away at pm now at almost pm all it says is driver has a few more stops funny it won't show exactly when it will arrive.,1,-1
Are you kidding! I love Amazon! So easy to send gifts to family and friends in other states when ever I want to. Wish all deliveries sent a picture of the drop off. But hey... still love the easy and convenience of Amazon.,5,1
I love it everything's great about it sometimes I don't understand why I have multiple fees to pay the prime I thought it was just once a month but sometimes they hit me with multiple prime fees throughout the month,5,1
"I had a order that a company said it delivered thru Amazon but I never recieved it. After much patience by myself, the amount was credited towards a reorder which I did. Another order was shipped it was a inconvenience, but the company at fault then delivered the item as promised. Restoring my further trust in Amazon.",5,1
For the past serval months the app gets stuck in a loop when trying to look at my ordered items list. As a result I can't check on how long I've owned something for a return under warranty. This needs fixed.,1,-1
"Excellent way to access Amazon shopping! Navigate the app with ease and very little ads. What's more, the ads you do get are almost always for something of your personal interest or needs! Useful ads?! Awesome!",5,1
Love this app and Love shopping on Amazon! They have everything there and the speedy fast delivery is free so it's probably the greatest shopping app/online shopping site available!!,5,1
"Positive and Good. Helpful and Kind phone associates no matter who is at fault. The drivers are polite, kind and careful with packages. I've tried other apps and I always find myself back at Amazon....it's the knowing you can trust your package will be DELIVERED! :)))",5,1
"Horrible functionality. Can't find anything, filters useless or non-existent, constantly recommended the same things over and over again. I hate Amazon",1,-1
Horrible UX experience with this. Had to go through tooth and nails to find invoices for my previous order just to give up on it and open my laptop to obtain the data. Yall need better UX staff.,2,-1
"Even after another update, it still takes  screens and long load time just to check on an order. The *old* app was way better, when it was much, much faster to check on your orders. Using this app is a pretty sucky experience now.",2,-1
"My shopping experience with amazon is good. It's the rude customer service agents I have a problem with. I informed an agent that my order was delivered to the wrong address. He was very rude and insisted it was delivered to my right address even after I gave him the correct address. Because of his attitude, I will steer clear of amazon as best as I can.",1,-1
they will deliver to the Amazon boxes which make picking up packages safer. plus I love that no matter what the strange object is I can always find it on Amazon,4,1
"Amazon shopping online is so easy to use from the comfort of your armchair, anything you can think of to purchase they more or less have it, make a wish list or buy straight away the choices are flexible for you",5,1
My very first experience with Amazon was a failure and I will never use them again. I tried purchasing a laptop and the order just kept on delaying. I contacted Amazon customer service and they could not help me. After speaking with  different helpline officials on  different occasions they finally decide to refund me. But they could never refund me the time they waisted if I would have known my package will never show up. I am disappointed and will never use Amazon again.,1,-1
I am a lifetime customer! The variety of shopping...I love it! And you get your packages fast the majority of time.,5,1
Don't waste your time with Amazon they have lost all value they once had. Save your time and money and use Ebay or Shopify way better value for your money.,1,-1
"I hate that you can't buy kindle books or prime video from the main app anymore. It doesn't make sense, why are you trying to fill up our phones with multiple apps? It was convinent the way it was. If you wanted to buy in Kindle app sure that's great. But if you had just been trying to have an easier time searching for series, or decided that you didn't want paperback/hardback after all, and switched to Kindle, the OG app was great for that. And you buy video on your phone to watch on your TV.",2,-1
It's shopping for me and my phone is a good thing to do with me. Amazon is shopping for buy a day or so I will send you some of myself.,5,1
I use Amazon almost daily but lately their shipping is either mostly late or a few instances it gets lost and doesn't arrive. Not sure what's been going on but I order products alot of times based on arrival and when they're a week or two late that's not good business,3,-1
"Always a new problem. How is Amazon the most enormous online retail giant but their app still can't function? Suddenly, the buttons that allow me to add items to my cart are gone - except for the ""bundle"" options, of course. If I want to buy just an armchair, I need to expand the table link, uncheck the boxes for the coffee table and couch I DON'T want and then I can put just the chair in my cart.",1,-1
Great service!,5,1
"Amazon shopping is truly brilliant. Prime movies... Sucks. Big time. You get movies free with prime, free shopping deliveries and loads more.",5,1
"Amazon used to be pretty reliable. Now they can't keep a schedule. Items that have prime delivery don't show up for weeks. The app doesn't update the shipping info so you have no idea when it'll show up. Customer service can't cancel or refund the purchase until it's returned so that's an endless cycle. Honestly if this was a one off, yeah things happen. But this has been happening for years. I pay for prime so can I get a refund for the dozens of orders that don't arrive by the guaranteed time?",1,-1
"Nothing easier than this app, and it's a lifesaver.",5,1
Very good app and easy to use. Recommend to everyone that wants cheap and easy items but theres a bug. My first two items i ordered didnt show up on my order history. Please fix that,5,1
Amazon and Klarma are absolutely hands down the best places to shop. Amazon prime is always shipping free and on time. If you ever have a issue they fix it with a refund or gift card. Love Amazon prime.  ⭐ quality service Everytime thank you ️,5,1
"If this was an app to see pictures of sad dogs, it would be  stars. All I ever see is those dogs and that something is wrong and to click the button for the home page. Then I get to see a new picture of a sad dog.",1,-1
Love Amazon. You shop order and pay and it's here. It's easy and simple any problems they help fix it. Customer service is excellent. Recommend it,5,1
Love this app. Never had any Issues with it and there's always your guarantee and refund if goods aren't as described. Thanks amazon,5,1
"Amazon cheating their customers with wrong information, so we can say they are lay to their customers as what happened to me. They offered me an item return, and when I tried to do the return for this broken item before that date. I can't do return because the return window was closed. I contacted the customer service and they just keep say something the return window is closed so we can't return the item or replace it and we lose our money for broken item.",1,-1
"Privacy - rape! Forces you now to allow camera permissions in order to access storage to upload review photos! Not in my household, and not for my children! This piece of trash app loses your place every time you exit and make you start all over from scratch when you reopen it. a ONE STAR! Loses your whole review.",1,-1
love amazon but the last update to the app design made it a bit confusing. I'm still trying to get used to it. but overall is a great app.,4,1
Amazon is just to convenient and I have never had any issues with getting my products undamaged and on time. I just love it.,5,1
I'vehad nothing but trouble with Amazon for a long time now where I've been subjected to a hate crime from some of the staff lies about delivery address and my parcels having the contents taken out of its original packaging and only empty boxes without the contents in the original box my SIM cards have had the security seal's broken and order's constantly being delayed for no reason And never getting money back and taking money when I tell them they do not have permission to. Nice one thanks,1,-1
The only thing I worry about is companies on Amazon often refuse to honor warranties. I bought a  year warranty and once the product broke after  months they stated it was somehow too late to return?!,4,1
"Never thought I enjoy online shopping so much. Amazing collection of items, fast delivery, and easy no hassle returns.",5,1
they can have really good cs until it come to the review team. they refuse to fix constant problems and the only help you receive is automated messages even when escalated by cs.,3,-1
Works well and use it almost daily although I have noticed that hitting the back button after checkout so that you can do more shopping reloads the cart with the previously purchased item leading to duplicate purchases.,4,1
"Support is inadequate. Agents refuse to provide a reference# and in one case deleted the whole contact. They deliberately use predatory lenders for their ""Amazon Credit Card"" who locked my account because I PAID IN FULL without any warning. They prey by UNCONSCIONABLE contract. They FREQUENTLY CHANGE THE ETA OF PACKAGES ON THE DAY THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DELIVERED! Illegally prevent screenshots against user rights and in bad faith. Defaults to subscription which is misleading pattern of practice",1,-1
"Simply amazing. I used to use Amazon to buy the odd thing that I couldn't find elsewhere but then I was able to get a student discount on Amazon Prime so I've been using Amazon much more since getting Prime and I have to say, they're wonderful. The prices are great, the free shipping, reliable delivery dates and tracking and the customer service is incredible.",5,1
"Only my nd order, but had concerns about extra charges by correos, but none on my first order, so very happy, and the prices at very good.",5,1
"The app cancelled and deleted an item I had ordered by itself, after waiting for  days. When I contacted the customer service to make a complaint, I wasted my time. My decision is not to deal with Amazon anymore.",1,-1
"In my last  orders,  arrived damaged,  were the wrong item,  was delivered to my neighbor,  was delivered to some random person and I never got it... So % of the items I ordered didn't need customer support help. That's an F minus minus minus. I'd rather pay more with B&H and NewEgg than deal with this hassle.",1,-1
"I always found this app easy to use but suddenly you're not allowed to buy books for your kindle from it  it says it's something to do with new Google policies, well I wish it would get sorted because I am an avid reader and love my kindle, so sort it please!!",4,-1
I love this app so much but when you write a complaint or whatever no one reads it so technically speaking you just made a useless comment. On the other hand you can get anything and every thing,4,1
"Customer service and warranties are hard to find. I have been using Walmart a lot after a disasterous delivery problem last year. They say an item is warrantied but when you finally find it it says ""Not this item"".",2,-1
"It's difficult to judge quality on most of the brands that come up. Quite often I've gotten much less than what I've hoped. I do have a monthly subscription yes, but the number of pitfalls make it hard to recommend. I like it cuz it keeps me from spending money. The doubt that stems from previous disappointments keeps me from wanting anything at all sometimes. The fact that gifting is an option seems cruel when quality isn't a guarantee with Amazon.",2,-1
"The Amazon app is such a handy app I really like it, quick on the go ordering without faffing about and finding goods is easy. Cheers.",5,1
Have found Amazon app convenient. They do seem to spam Mt email about some of the things I want or have in the save for later. Don't have any other problems. The prime delivery service is worth it's weight in gold and convenience. Would recommend it to others.,5,1
"I don't like having Amazon, legit just an emergency usage to have on my phone, love going straight to the seller which works out cheaper than using Amazon",1,-1
You can no longer buy ebooks through this app you have to use a computer which is ridiculous. I hope Amazon is gonna buy me a computer to continue to purchase ebooks cause this is just horrible. I'm so frustrated because suddenly I am now expected to buy a computer just to purchase an ebook. Absolutely ridiculous and un called for and unnecessary!,1,-1
"Amazon WILL, without warning, subscribe you to Prime. I never signed up, but I was still charged the $. for a subscription, and because I didn't know what went wrong, I ended up voiding my debit card, and I had to end up waiting for a new one. This was absolutely ridiculous.",1,-1
"this site has been helpful most of the time. some stuff I have to return because the size was wrong, but other than that pretty good",5,1
"They changed app, no option for changing country from app. It used be easy for accessing different markets",1,-1
"Fantastic app, almost as functional as the full website. Clearly some considerable effort has gone into this solution and it shows.",5,1
This is the second time i order and they did not deliver. They did not inform the costumer. When i checked now because im expecting in an hour. I discover that they will deliver by next day. And i am subscribed for a year at amazon prime. And i am very disappointed because this is not the first time. I will not recommend this to all my friend. Very worst app!,1,-1
As far as the app experience it's been good for me they have were you can just sign up and do shopping but they also have amozon prime it cost around - dollars a month if you shop a lot or just need things for the house than this app is for you happy shopping,5,1
Was excellent quality and excellent value for money . Then the boxes were broken and looked like they had been stepped on don't no why also little bits of money being taken out of account don't no why.,5,1
"Amazon is my FAVORITE place to shop online. Fast and easy checkout. Haveing prime my items come within  days, some even come the next day. Returns are effortless and you have your money refunded back to you within a day. I cant say enough about Amazon I literally love everything about it!!!!",5,1
I put this as a  star rating bc when I put the money to TRINIDAD & TOBAGO it just takes me out of the app and when I click back the app it just shows a lagging screen rlly quickly and then put me on my home page on my phone I had to delete the app and download it twice I deleted and I'm downloading it back rn so now I have to put the money to USA which is rlly expensive down here,1,-1
"Gets worse with every update. Wish list hard to scroll through, now can't see the map or it's glitching. Terrible",2,-1
Needs to get a grip of delivery options. Some things are only available next day delivery for some ridiculous reason but some are the day after. It won't let me choose Amazon Day delivery and get it all together. Really inconvenient for me and probably for Amazon too!,2,-1
I like the convenience. live in the boonies and sometimes just easier to go on line. most prices are competitive with Walmart. Yearly Prime SHOULD NOT continue to rise considering the money Amazon profits which is made public and very well known. The. cost of Prime continuing to rise would be my reason to stop using Anazon,4,1
"Not user friendly. Just trying to browse a specific department, but can't find a way to do that. Would be nice if end-users could customize their experience. Fix your app!",2,-1
I love using Amazon Shopping app. it is very easy to use and navigate. I'm not very tech-savvy and I seem to explore the app just fine. the app makes it easy to save/favorite items to get at a later date. easy to reload gift card balances. lots of items offer free shipping.,5,1
The web browser's works better. The app doesn't load/work unless i'm using data and even when I do use data the app is very limited in what items it allows me to view. I miss the old Amazon app.,2,-1
I hate this damn app so much. It has put my account on hold for no reason! All I've done was order a shirt and pants and all of a sudden that's considered suspicious activity. and this has happened in the past and it's irritating.,1,-1
Ive always been very very pleased with the way Amazon has conducted business. Ive never had a problem with returns. I am so excited to be a Prime member.,5,1
"No reason for me to have prime anymore. Almost nothing I order is delivered in a couple of days. And the way they process the monthly fee is terrible. I use a online bank account to pay the monthly fee and I have forgot to transfer money to that account and they will go through any of the cards on file to make a payment. Doesn't matter what name is on the card, they will run the card. They don't send a notification saying card was declined before trying every card on file.",3,1
I love how fast and easy it is to shop on Amazon. No rude clerks when I have to return something because it didn't work.,5,1
"New update is laggy, and viewing product details is now slowly rendered like loading a web page back in the s. Sometimes product details don't even fully load, or UI buttons to expand text are missing randomly. And doesn't matter what you search for, it'll be drowned out by sponsored items",3,-1
Pay for Prime and EVERY delivery takes longer then the US Postal Service. I pay for Prime and same day or next day delivery is offered and then on day of scheduled delivery SORRY YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN DELAYED and I have  warehouses within  miles of my residence Maybe next week delivery if you are lucky. Check with actual sellers their delivery maybe faster. Will no longer pay $. for Prime. They don't deserve my money anymore,1,-1
"Amazon Egypt , - I ordered something and in payment processing step, I received **payment failure** from the application so I cancelled it, few moments later I received payment deduction message from bank and when I called them, they said ""I have to wait from - working days to get my money back"". - my brother has ordered some product and we received it not matching the product specs and when we tried to write a review to warn others, they said it will take more than  months to post it",1,-1
"it's Amazon, trade convenience for higher price. While they may be more expensive than most there is excellent customer service. if they could just sort out the third parties selling stuff at * the store cost because no one noticed it would be a lot better ",4,-1
Doesn't let you select your price range. So that it becomes difficult to find the product in your exact range and you end up buying the product they want sell,1,-1
"Love the app, so easy and convenient as far as shopping goes. Prime service, love the shows available and sometimes the delivery service is ok. Only one question, what does ""delivered to a safe place"" mean. And why don't drivers take photos like they use too. Half the time my package has been missing and now where to be found. Don't get me wrong, it's replaced right away, but so inconvenient.",3,-1
"I have been prime for over  years and on Mother's day this company has had me in tears over  dollars, the customer is always wrong with them.  hours of arguing to get $ refund that should have been automatic, after a migraine and tears supposedly I will get  back in another  hours, buyer be ware",1,-1
"So amazon has changed there review protocols. You can't write if the seller has bad service, bad shipping, or horrible customer service. The way they have it you only can put a good review up bad reviews get stopped. I have been using WM lately do to better service and shipping. Complained about a problem to them no questions asked and was refunded, amazon has made it a battle to return or replace a broken item. Amazon is failing all around. So sad.",1,-1
"Changed region, now app won't even open. Worked perfectly in UK,. Com have to use a browser.",1,-1
"Amazon is faithful. Through the pandemic this was sometimes the fastest and easiest (and even the only way) to get essential and nonessential items. I have had great experiences on rare occasions when it was necessary to call customer service. I love the vast product selection, the ability to ship to multiple addresses, shipping speed, and my Amazon Wallet!",5,1
Amazon tiene bueno servicios cuando son membresía. sin la cuenta prime las cosas tardan y nunca llega. I never received my package  and then I got in trouble after because by doing the missing orders fraudulent people stole my bank account information. Trying to take out the money. it happened two times to me. I wonder how they know each time when I buy something I received call or bank account notification.,4,-1
It seems like they just go out of their way to make things harder and harder... and p.s. stop shoving Alexa in our faces constantly. Just STOP.,1,-1
"Horrible customer service, horrible account assistance. Recently my phone linked to the account was deactivated and I lost my phone number permanently, I'm trying to attach my new one and I'm clearly logged in but when I try changing my number it sends a verification website link to the deactivated phone. I was in contact with Account Change and have done everything to verify myself but suddenly they need a ""Charge ID"" which I cannot provide because I don't use a bank with Amazon. cant help me!!",1,-1
"A few times recently, it's 'if you order within x hours, you'll receive it in x time' has been totally out! I could also ask, if you could move the heart button to save into wish list, as I'm forever touching it by mistake!",3,-1
I love shopping with Amazon! They have some if the coolest things you'll find. I buy everything! Customer service is Amazing as well.,5,1
I am one proud ex amazonian and I know how much Amazon care for their customers. Plus my shopping continues with Amazon and ends with Amazon. Prime items only ️,5,1
"Ive used the app before and I was wonderful then! Maybe it was  or early ? Either way, this app has gone down in quality faster than my self confidence. It let's WAY too many scams pass by, which obviously makes people lose money. Another problem is that, even after changing my password, I can't sign in. What the hell happened? This app was better back then! Please, for the love of god, fix this damned app.",1,-1
Every time I open the app it works for about a minute then crashes. Very annoying and it makes me wonder if paying for prime is worth it if I can't even browse Amazon.,1,-1
"Don't get me wrong. this app is very good and has so many options on how to place and pay for your orders. The thing is: options narrows when buying from 🇵🇷. that's a shame, because in my case I pay for a Prime Membership and that is $. just to have... ""free shipping""? (most of the time I pay double for an item just to know I could buy it for less in my country). But delivery is fast enough to be happy and the goods quality is good too.",3,-1
"Amazon is the best place to shop. I have been a customer of Amazon for a number years and what I found is that Amazon is reliable, that the customer service is excellent. What I find most about customer service is that the customer service representatives are sincere, you can hear it in their voice. They are not just repeating the buzz words that were discussed at management meetings, that someone thinks customers want to hear. I will always be a Amazon customer.",5,1
"This app is pretty good for the most part. I would like to see improvements made to the filters. Also, its very difficult to figure out how to contact a seller. I've passed on buying many items because I couldn't ask the seller a question.",3,1
Scrolling is broken. Trying to look through my lists and it won't go down below the first few items.,1,-1
"Amazon is amazing and allows me to purchase so many things from here that at times I might not see the same items in stores, very original and helpful",5,1
I hate it when order is split...that is a wastage of time...so i have to wait for a delivery on  or  different days...very disguisting...i'd rather you take a whole week but deliver once,3,-1
"Amazon is really easy to order and it only take two days to get my order. Anything over $. purchase is free shipping. It may be lower, I'm not sure because I get my free shipping because I have a Prim video account so its free for me. Iv'e been using this Amazon more than any other app for buying anything, so far I haven't had any problems. And Amazon has everything I want or need.",5,1
"Shopping experience changed for the worst. I use to enjoy shopping, strolling through pictures and reviews. The pictures are very choppy, uneasy to scroll through, there's a stutter/hesitation between pictures. I have to swipe hard,  or  times to get to the next picture. Zooming use to be smoother.",2,-1
love shopping with Amazon. If anything happens it's easy to get a refund or help with that item.. Would recommend Amazon to all my friends & family,5,1
When ever I click filter by price it auto adds filters killing the results down from  to  when i try to take off the filtering on the categories it wont let me filter by price. Feels very under handed and dishonest.,3,-1
"overnight shipping is not overnight any more. it is now  day shipping. and vday shopping is not realy  day shipping, it is  or maybe even  day shipping. I have been a Prime member since Beta testing, and I don't find these new definitions acceptable. Even more so knowing I live less than an hour from  or  Amazon distribution centers. Things are not what they were.",3,-1
The app is useless. Constant oops doggy popping up instead your orders. Uninstalled.,1,-1
"Slow app, a lot of errors and trouble shooting, every now and then change language by itself, if any mistake in payment very difficult to resume or correct again. I wonder how big and international company like amazon has such weak incompetent app",1,-1
this app keeps crashing on me and uninstalling itself. weird. never had a issue before untill the last week. zero stars.,1,-1
Slowest app ever. Then it stops trying if your connection is bad (like if you're in your house) and nothing ever loads,2,-1
"Android: This app has gone downhill since the redesign. It's like a crowded flea market. Too much content in your face. The cancel an item button doesn't work on one item I'm waiting for so I have to waste my time and chat. On top of that, guess what? There's no customer service button (disappeared)! That's right. Chat thought I was crazy. I went through the website to access them! Fixthese issues. And redesign this ugly and non fluent app",1,-1
"Not being able to buy digital content through the app makes it worthless to me. I will use the browser, I guess.",1,-1
Sometimes the packages aren't on time but it's good shopping experience  Amazon is one of my best friends. #DayShipping,4,-1
"This app desperately needs a feature that locks your filters. A permanent seller button would also be very helpful. One that's present without me having to pick a category. Once I no longer have to tamper with these settings after every search, it'll be perfect!",3,1
"I'm getting sick and tired of unauthorized charges being made to my account by Amazon prime. I simply was looking on the app for things to purchase when I went on my account later and saw two of my cards were charged for two months without my permission. I had that money for savings to pay off a debt but now I have to call and tell Amazon to remove these charges. After this, I think I'm done and gonna switch back to ebay and Wayfair.",1,-1
"the app worked fine up till recently it keeps changing my language setting been doing this a few months now, kinda a hassle so i just havent been on it. i should t have to change it back ever time i open the app or seach something. and when its in the wrong language its even harder to figure out to change ir back.",1,-1
"WATCH YOUR WALLET! I recently had to purchase a hot water heater for a camper and the listed price was $. When I checked the email a couple days later, it said I paid $. How is that possible you ask? They have made a policy where their prices are jubjectto change at essentially any time. The price of this item is still $ last I checked. I feel robbed. So, me thinking corporations are honest enough (foolish choice) without reconfirming the price cashed out and went about my day. I asked",3,-1
No longer able to purchase kindle books through the app due to new rule?? I cant buy other products and hard copy books but not kindle books. Pain in the neck now if I see a book I want that I have to go onto the website to order instead. Recent change and a stupid change.,1,-1
I don't want to cancel any items. Love them all. An emergency came up and not enough was in my account. Had to get a used car. It would be great to get my orders. I'm out of everything. These things are so important to me. I have about a year left w my liver. My next payment for all can come out June  rd. Thank you for all and understanding. God Bless Hu an See,5,-1
"Disappointing. I only use this app to contact customer service when there is a problem with an order (which unfortunately is happening a lot more frequently), because they pretty much force you to contact them that way. This app lacks the functionality of the actual website. Also a big negative is that I can not order via AmazonSmile on it. I am a Prime member but don't receive consistent prime service. Orders are often late or lost. Sad that as the prime fee goes up the quality goes down.",3,-1
I love and hate this app. I love it because there's thousands upon thousands of Great deals they'll deliver straight to your home. I hate it because it makes me want to spend money because of the great deals that they will deliver straight to your home,4,-1
"Ok, so I clicked a deal notification and next thing I know I somehow purchased it without ever clicking that button??? And then it refuses to let me say ""no i really don't want this item"" and it nows says should be here tomorrow but i still don't want the item... please fix this",4,-1
"not happy at present that I was sent  sachets of seeds I hadn't ordered, instead of the  items I did order, which I now have to mess about and order again, after trying several methods of contacting someone. Makes no sense to me.",3,-1
"THIS ORDER: I changed my mailing address A package arrived on the porch as requested. The problem? It's in  or  packages. One came here. One went wrongly to our P.O. Box. The others went to my old address where contractors are stripping and ""flipping"" it! FOR OTHER TIMES: It's convenient. I don't like things about their operations and management, but setting up a house for our disabled son to live alone, you constantly think of stuff you need. They typically get stuff to you.",2,-1
"Love the items, the no hassle return policy etc pay for prime even though it takes a few extra days not that big of a deal. But this app is absolutely frustrating. Since day one. Lags, freezes, stops etc etc. Plz fix it. Update over a year later . Still sucks .",3,1
"Hi Amazon, i would like to suggest a tiny feature to Amazon, basically the feature/function is already there but its in a wrong place. Its (Sort) feature. This sort feature is in the 'filter feature"" instead of being stand alone/Separate function. Which is really annoying. All other ecom stores have it separate on their app but Amazon I don't know this important function is added in filter option. Kindly make this necessary changes it will make Amazon wonderful.  stars because of ""sort"" featur",3,-1
Works well most the time but occasionally freezes and locks the phone out and I need to hard reboot the device. Would be good if smile.amazon.* links opened in the app rather than browser only.,3,-1
It's good app but it need more tweaks like aliexpress that can know what you like and make a full pages of suggestions also you can multi choose on the list of buy or wish list or what to delete from them . Your app need to be smarter that's all,3,-1
Never had any issues that weren't resolved instantly by Amazon Customer Support. Great source for online shopping.,5,1
"Hi, Please kindly provide us with System Light/Dark Mode for this must have App. Its a shame other shopping Apps such as Ebay etc have this most requested feature. I'll do  Stars if the Developers grant us this request. Thanks.",2,-1
"Not up to par. App constantly freezes and crashes after about - minutes of searching and use. I then have to start back over and try my best to find where I left off in my searching endeavors. Also, when selecting to view all questions, the button to show more questions is missing. So, I can only view about  of them. If I want to view more, I have to use the browser version.

"Funny, no mention that this update removes digital purchases from the app. Please add a ""orders widget"" so I don't have to keep up a separate note in google keep, to keep track of my orders and delivery dates. While you're at it, please include a description of the items I purchase in the emails you send to me about my purchases, instead of only listing the order number.",3,-1
"I can't get past Amazon's poor search functionality, poor customer service and switch tactics enough to buy from them anymore. Account deleted. Congrats on loosing a customer",2,-1
The app closes at least once every single time I open it. I've Uninstalled & reinstalled with no change.,2,-1
Primarily use this app for ebook purchase. Not sure why the Google play store stuck its' oar in. But now when wanting to purchase ebooks I get a message saying to use my browser and log in to purchase ebooks due to following the Google play store rules. If that's the way things are going to be no point to downloading this app.,1,-1
Amazon groceries needs to look at the directions people put how to get to your house or your apartment they never find my apartment and I always have to stand outside for  minutes waiting for them so they I make sure they find it it's very simple you just go to the back of the building and my door is there and it says the address and apartment B right on the door it's not hard,5,1
"Makes shopping Amazon really easy. Great app and great service. I just dealt with a customer rep for replacing a defective item. She made it very easy and cooperated and my new item will be here tomorrow. I just have to send the old one back within the next  weeks. Good customer service is a breath of fresh air. Every time I have to confront a customer service rep they always get the issue resolved. So no worries if an item is broken when you get it, they will replace it.",5,1
Sent me out a broken item. No customer service for returns. Just a silly returns procedure that needs revamping immediately. Thought Amazon was better than this.,1,-1
"I purchased an earphones from Amazon but after few  months they stopped working, I tried to claim warranty by contacting the company but they denied me service after that I contacted Amazon, they said they will help me in this and if the company doesn't gives me warranty for which they said was  year , Amazon will either exchange them or give you a refund but it's been more than  days everytime I call Amazon they are giving me dates after date. They aren't doing anything regarding this.....",1,-1
"For two days in a row I'm unable to pick up my packages at the Amazon locker. There isn't a way I can find to contact technical support about their bug! The help doesn't have a radio button for my situation. I just tried to use the app to write a review. I switched to a different app when I was almost done, to look up something on the web, and when I returned my review was wiped clean! Only the first number of stars was still registered.",1,-1
"It is a great application, even though it has its flaws. Giving the consumer the opportunity to shop from home without the hassle of waiting in line to pay for there purchases. It makes the process more bearable. My biggest complaint with Amazon is that sometimes items that I order will be delivered damaged. They have a decent customer service though that tends to be able too handle the situation.",4,-1
"I was satisfied with this app until a few days ago when my amazon page switched my language from English to Spanish. I do not speak effin Spanish! There is no where on the page to switch it back! Why would this be done without my authorization!? I am very frustrated, annoyed and angry!! I am uninstalling this app!!",1,-1
Chat agents are horrible and unhelpful. They close out the chat before the issue is resolved in order to keep from being rated poorly. When an agent closes out the chat it asks you and prompts you to rate them. When they do a poor job they're immediately closing out the chat to keep from being negatively rated! Horrible experience!! They need better training.,1,-1
"Basicly Good But...since a couple updates ago, app often freezes while using it. Could be my phone or my service provider? Perhaps but bug happens while connected to strong wi-fi, also. // Update: App updated not for the ""better"" IMO. Still freezes. // Ok, finally app is working well.",3,-1
Quick and easy,5,1
"My phone came with this app already installed. The reason ""Amazon shopping"" has a  star rating from me is because I can't delete it off my phone, despite me seldom even browsing with it. I would almost guarantee that it's an awesome app for online shopping, but I don't care for having my freedom of choice removed.",1,-1
"I love Amazon! Their products are always great quality and very reasonably priced! You can always find what your looking for here! Amazon even beats Walmart on a lot of their products, for selections and price!!",5,1
"App is slow. And the last  packages I have ordered have been delayed or canceled...I pay for prime, my packages shouldn't take  days to get here when they are supposed to be prime eligible. Ridiculous",2,-1
"Ever since i updated it, its been in spanish. Im not that great at reading it but i got to the language preference and changed it to english, hit save and its still in spanish.",2,-1
"Pop-up/push notifications need more categories - I want notifications about my orders and account, but your suggestions/sales need to be on another channel I can unsubscribe from. Thanks",3,-1
Slow and unusable. I have a galaxy note  . Everything else on my phone runs great. Amazon app searches take minutes to complete if they complete at all. Most of the time i gett an oops message. I spend a fair chunk of cash each month with them. If this app remains this way much longer i will look elsewhere for goods. As slow as it is its unusable. My phone is my only internet access so fix it or i cannot use your service. This is just the main bug out of a dozen other issues...,1,-1
Amazon is the BEST place to find what you need at the BEST price. Having it delivered to your front door and not have to deal with going to the store is just icing on the cake!,5,1
always great deals on stuff and it comes fast to you. definitely would refer anyone to Amazon to get the things they need.,5,1
I don't understand why Amazon fresh all of a sudden doesn't let me see my orders when I order food items!? I have an Android tablet  which is only a year old. It use to let me see my items just months ago. Now it tells me that my android is not compatible with the Amazon fresh brand and To go to my browser or mobile phone To check items that weren't delivered !?. This is really ridiculous and I'm wondering if I should even have this app or Amazon.,2,-1
"The app mostly works fine but Ive been having issues with my phone lately. Like my google assistant wasnt working so I decided to try bixby and that informed me, your mic is already in use by amazon... fairly scummy in my opinion",2,-1
I love shopping Amazon Prime. I can find almost anything I'm looking for. I can research the reviews. I can research the best manufacturers and sellers. It's the way to go for me.,5,1
Buyer beware. Cheap stuff with annoying after sales support. I often look for local/brick and mortar suppliers before resorting to this. Most times I can find better locally which helps support my neighbourhood. JB doesn't need my cash.,3,1
I like things that are easy to buy,5,1
Of course a  star review! You can't go wrong with Amazon! They have so many things you can get even if they are useless I love them either way,5,1
just amazing sometimes you have to look for other purchase options because some options are desrer than others but App normally sorts that for you and most stuff is next day delivery which is fantastic!!!,5,1
New Update is Horrible! It tells me there was a problem on their end all the time. I'm about to stop shopping with them it's so bad.,1,-1
"Good app, one thing that I wish they had was a optional ranking in the lists you create. What you would want st, nd, rd, and so on. This would be helpful for birthday, Christmas, wedding, and baby registry lists so people would know what you wantor need the most. Just an idea Amazon. Credit me when you do it. You know it would be awesome. Ok, I know you have a priority option but I would like it to be ordered in a specific order.",4,-1
Amazon has been timely and the products are good. This delivery is taking a very long time for some reason and I have not received any notifications why the delay.,4,1
"WE ARE IN , AND THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO HAVE DARK MODE LIKE EVERY OTHER APP! It's so stupid simple. You're losing money. Everyone HATES shopping on Amazon in the evening because it's way too bright. Please take ten minutes to add this feature. Why don't you want millions more people browsing and buying in the evening/night? Please fix it or add an option so it doesn't take you to your cart everytime you add an item to it. It's so annoying having to go back and waiting for it to load again.",1,-1
"Well I love this app it's no secret and you can use your prime account for discounts at whole foods. Great shopping app that gives all kinds of discounts at the most oddest times of the day but who cares you can fins everything for a much better price than anywhere you can go to and it gets delivered right to your door step with a freaking picture to shoe you exactly where they dropped it off. I mean it's awesome and did I mention whole foods discounts for prime members, yea I did. Bravo Amazon",5,1
"I was a big fan of Amazon before what ever I order from them COD is like  click away! Now everything changes, you found the item in Amazon but COD is not Available... It's like you lost your rights as a costumer! Will anyway what can I do if this there decision better I will removed Amazon from one of my favorite list..",1,-1
"look I love amazon as an avid clothes shopper and such. it's great  buying but the app itself is really glitchy and very hard to navigate the options within the app... very odd. I'd like to give this higher than a , but I just can't. it's not deserved.",3,1
The interface is bad. The old Souq app interface was simpler and wasn't messy. They're a lot of mistakes happen with orders. A lot of untrused sellers sell their fake products there. This app is a joke compared to old souq app.,1,-1
"This used to be great, but now I'm having huge issues. I can't add anything to my cart. It just says failed to add. Same when I try to buy now. I have to go to my computer, re-look up the item and do it all there because it won't even let me add to a list... really annoying...",1,-1
App is easy to use but needs more consistent sort and filter options. There was a recent change that now prevents purchasing Kindle books and you have to go to a web browser. This is very inconvenient if you're mixing product purchases. Might as well not use the app!,3,-1
"Getting less and less likely to order anything as it has out grown and is becoming a hit and miss of what was ordered. Some of this is due to other vendors selling on the platform, and some is to rapid growth with no control.",3,1
App just ok. But search terrible and so many errors its constantly switching to another dog sayings opps error on our end. How about diverting a few dollars from trips into almost-space and hire some decent IT people who know what they're doing.,2,-1
"***EDITED*** How do you find and manage monthly payments via the app? I love Amazon and the app works really well. My only little gripe is you can't leave seller feedback in the app, if you can I can't find it. I have to log in via my mobile browser, switch to desktop view and do it that way. Please make it so we can do it via the app, thank you.",5,1
"It's as if they're trying to make the app terrible. The menu button pulls up the menu but also opens a drawer containing ""shortcuts"". The shortcuts cannot be hidden or removed, and the drawer takes up / of the screen. Scrolling through lists often has a rubberband effect - list scrolls a bit and then jumps back to the previous position.",1,-1
"This stupid app suddenly started popping up advertisement notifications. No idea where they have buried the app preferences to control what notifications the app sense. Something delivered yes, I want to know. You think that I want news about some stupid item that your flawed algorithm thinks I want--NO! This just started with a recent update.",1,-1
"Like others are saying the latest version of the app sucks, The older one was great. At first was able to do some things though it took a very long time to get there. But know I can't do anything. All it does now is show me photos of dogs.",5,1
"I love Amazon! I like the quick shipping, the easy return options and I don't have to spend time running around to stores. It's a time saver and money saver.",5,1
My phone is in English and I want to use the app in English. The app keeps resetting to French without any option to change it back to English anymore. Very annoying. I do understand French but I don't want my search to be translated.,1,-1
"Amazon pays for abortions now ($ per employee for travel). App is slow, bloated, and way too many permissions. They try to charge you for Prime every time you check out.",1,-1
Very bad service!!! So many problems in one order. *After reordering* I got the wrong item which costs less than half of the ordered item's cost,1,-1
I just love it. Always works. Easy to purchase items (sometime a little difficult to find them but I think that may be intentional - ie. Showing competition first).,5,1
Went from a  star to  star customer service is horrible it's as if Amazon is making harder to get a hold of somebody and the customer services reps are incompetent. It's slowly becoming another ebay with shady sellers and shady used items.,2,-1
Normally would be a  star review as the app usually performs well but this last update has caused it to lag while trying to navigate anywhere on the app. I can't edit my lists like for example if I try to move an item from one list to another it just brings me back to the top of the page. If I try to delete an item it freezes. It freezes constantly. Even the webpage is performing slowly/buggy but it's still better than the app at present date so that's what I'm using for now until they fix this,1,-1
"I love shopping Amazon. It's fast. Cost effective. Easy from anywhere. I have a Few Irritations though.... MAIN COMPLAINT!!! If you're a Prime Member, of course you want to buy things as a Prime Member. Why??? CONSTANTLY do you have to hit the button telling the app that's how you are shopping. Understandable, if it's the first time shopping that day, hit that little button, slide it over, yes! You were shopping through Prime. But NO, CONTINUOUSLY!! Every single thing you do. I PASS",2,-1
Its horrible i just tried to use it for the st time it says to download the app and create an account and for new users you get  off your  order.Well st i was trying to get gardening things plant food for . and cactus food n soil it was .$ it came to .  how does that add up thats with free delivery on top of it didnt get $ off for being a new account holder n downloading the app.I waited til customer service called me and and explained all the issues and she was no help,1,-1
"Incredibly Slow loading when purchase options are shown. When I need to change either a size, or color selection... It's ridiculous. Literally can take minutes to alter the selection. And when I click the photo to see the images closer, that's another  seconds. Zooming in SOMETIMES works. Overall it's a good app, but this aspect makes me not even be able to select the size options I need. Please fix it. It's not a problem with my phone considering it's one of the latest Androids. Thank you",1,-1
This app is great but they are scams but over all it's great sometimes I look up something and not get what I need and I think it's way better than wish,3,-1
"Amazon is great.... But the recent app update is an absolute load of rubbish, many things in the menu are harder to find and use... Hence two stars... Before the app change I would have given  stars every day of the week.... The app upgrade is a nightmare...",2,-1
"Been with prime for  years. Lateness is becoming more and more common lately. They keep raising membership prices for what? One day shipping isn't guaranteed and customer service will pull whatever answer to blame the problem on something else but them. Amazon music service is trash and prime video is bottem teir at best. New people looking to buy the membership, just know there are better options. Don't fall for the gimmick.",2,-1
"I would say, probably the most best shopping app globally! I would love to see it everywhere in the world. I trust it as it really protects the buyer.",5,1
"I have won well over , online gambling. I have been playing for at least  years. I send to Amazon. They accept it alright BUT i havent received a penny. Have complained, begged, cried( need the $ BADLY), asked for help nicely, not so nicely, and EVERYWHERE in between to no avail. Im disabled ( thats why i cried and begged) with severe PTSD and am unable to drive. I thought I had deleted but ITS BACK. Like a bad habit. The  time i actually talked  a live person they "" accidentally "" hungup",1,-1
My app on my phone at some point yesterday or today went Spanish. I unfortunately don't speak or read Spanish. It was a good app until now. Will gave to Uninstaller as I can't navigate to try reset to English.,3,-1
"App is trash, use a PC if you can. I've never been able to open links sent through text without jumping through hoops as to not just end up on the home page. The apps back buttons while in the cart are in the same areas as the place order button so when the app lags you'll place the order. Endless scrolling just to get to the reviews section.. just a lot of bad. App needs some new brains.",1,-1
Don't get prime. Prime is fun and all but they don't pay their drivers and they don't respond to their support system. I used to be a flex driver but no longer. Company doesn't know how to run properly all they care about a making more money from yall while they get rich.,1,-1
"I used to think that my son was crazy for using Amazon .Now I don't go to stores and use it for everything. Amazon is cheaper than Walmart ! And you dont get sucked into extra purchases when you stroll through the store. We actually bought entire ASSEMBLED bedroom set (was cheaper then Wayfair) last month. It was scary, but successful purchase,delivered to the door. Amazon is a game changer if you live in boonies or in places Florida Keys where there are mo stores Returns are Super easy !",5,1
"Amazon's security is the worst ever. Scammers can withdraw money from your account for items you didn't pay for or subscription you didn't make. My account was just debited of £ for Prime subscription and when I checked my account, it states I'm not on such. If Amazon can't fix their security breeches, then go off the market. I need a refund of my money. REFUND MY MONEY!!!",1,-1
"I've used this app for a long time now and its been amazing, but out of nowhere it randomly switches to Spanish. No matter how many times I switch it back to English. My profile page is still in Spanish and eventually goes completely back to Spanish",1,-1
Been a regular customer of Amazon Prime for a good few years now. I love it! Never once not been able to find exactly what I want; how do they do it? Utterly astounding! I've just opened a Business Account also so see how that works out..,5,1
for some reason it doesn't let me do any reviews. I have reached out many times to costumer service to fix the problem and noone ever even gets back to me which is pretty frustrating and disappointing.,2,-1
There's nothing I can't find on Amazon. Love my Prime subscription and online shopping is the only thing my work schedule allows for. So convenient for me,5,1
"Having a great experience shopping at Amazon !!! It's fast shipping, most of the items I had come was packed really well, I've had bad experience with the cleaning liquid, most of it has leaked out, hating to sending it back, I put up with the loss of the cleaning liquid, but overall it's been awesome waiting on my ...Thank you Amazon for making my shopping much easier and affordable!!!!",5,1
"Been using it for years, and love being able to bulk buy, or have it delivered the next day. The subscribe and save is another great option.",5,1
Having issues with opening up the order menu keep saying something went wrong at our end. I have to use the web browser to go to check my order or finded my past orders if I want to reorder again.,2,-1
"I love Amazon shopping, maybe a little too much. If you are in North America and you are shopping in China it's always good to get the biggest size. We are bigger than they are.",5,1
Every few months they change the layout. I never really see an improvement. The only thing I notice that is really different is I need to relearn how to use it. Now there is a floating alexa button that I can't turn off. Search function is horrible. I can't do any advanced searches. Sometimes I am lucky if more than % of the results are relevant.,1,-1
This AP was working just fine. Now it wont show orders. I can see the orders online just fine. Any chance of fixing. Love this AP when it works.,3,-1
"Amazon has gone way down hill. They charge more for membership now, but I keep getting broken items or the wrong size. They whole point is I don't have to leave my house, but now I have to go to ups to return my orders that are broken or wrong because of them. I am getting very frustrated and it just keeps getting worse.",1,-1
"This app used to run fine, but now you can't buy digital content from it. But you also can't buy music in the music app. So...I guess if I'm out I need to run to find the nearest computer?",1,-1
Overall ok. The monthly cost is too high and I'm debating canceling services like my Netflix.,2,-1
"Used to be much better. Can no longer see my ""saved for later"" list beyond  items even though I have well over  items saved.",2,-1
Some of the items are a hit or miss. It's hard to go off reviews due to sellers bribing customers.,3,-1
the shipping needs to be improved. most items are way too long for shipping. I'm paying for a prime membership for what. I can sometimes go directly to the online store and order with free and faster shipping. why does Amazon allow scalping. some of the items are  to  times the amount.,2,-1
Only purchasing options are easy to find. Anything that isn't spending more difficult,3,1
"I love that all my household needs are at my fingers. After having a baby it is really helpful that I can have items delivered to my door. Diapers, wipes, essential oils, clothing, lamps, shampoo, lotion, anything and every thing that our family needs. I would rather shop local but here in Alaska there are few options.",5,1
I can not get the MY ORDERS section to display. It just keeps searching. My recent orders were delivered weeks ago and still show out for order. I have a return and can not send back because it doesn't show as being received. Never had this problem in the past.,1,-1
"I use this app daily. There's a reason Amazon is the best at what it does. Everyone else is just now figuring it out since Covid hit, but Amazon, they started years prior. They are my ""go-to"" store from everything food wise (love that  hr delivery!) to pet needs household furniture. Amazon makes everything easier... even with the occasional return, the process is easy follow and they credit back immediately. A+++ If I could have given this  stars, I would have. #DieHardNinerFan",5,1
"Amazon has made it easier for returns at Khols with barcaode...greatly appreciated. Thank you for near by pickup locations...no worries about stolen packages...but downside Amazon ur breaking my pockets....addictive shopping, I don't usually buy alot but now more than usual.",5,1
"Busy schedule, many more options than retail stores, decently priced. l would like to really know how to use rewards system. I only rated  stars because we don't want Amazon to think they are the cats meow and not continue to perform. keep up the good work.",4,1
The most recent update brought some very needed performance improvements but navigation got totally fubared. Now I can't go to my lists nor orders. Only the cart and 'home' are accesible.,2,-1
With the update in April my account now is in Spanish. I have tried several times to rest to English but unable to do so Very upset since I don't understand Spanish. May have to just delete my account.,1,-1
I love shopping on Amazon saves me time going to the grocery store when there are items that I don't need right away I also love the payment options on some items ️️️,5,1
"It is hard to see the product by just looking at the picture and reading the description, we have prime so we can order and return it with no problem but still Amazon gave us problems for doing that, so it is wasting time to order online because we can not see the product.",1,-1
"Too many irrelevant search results  contacted their Technical Support, they said they can't stop it. Also, the prime joining notification every single time one opens the app, it pops up covering your homepage, they just want you to buy their products, otherwise, they don't care, and this is shameful as much as it's ridiculous. Ya'll bigger than this! Update: Purchased something, got notification saying delivered while it wasn't. Contacted Amazon the dummy girl couldn't help with $it. Crappies",1,-1
"If you use any of the sorting options (like ""price: low to high"" because you can't filter by price) it was take out thousands of options. Designed to make you waste time looking through thousands of items.",1,-1
"I have been having issues trying to see my orders for months now. It will either not load or I get the Uh-Oh message too. This is ridiculous and needs to be fixed now. I use Amazon for all my non-perishable shopping needs, clothing, and gifts, etc. I spend a lot of money monthly. However I am getting extremely frustrated with this problem. I hope they read these Reviews if not they may lose many customers.",2,-1
Deceptive and predatory... Can't cancel subscriptions in app. Can't do it in browser because browser only opens in app. We know exactly what you're trying to do here and it's cheap and deceptive.,1,-1
"One crazy thing about this app is that it gives you no notification anywhere that you've received a message. Instead you have to click four buttons to see if you have any, if you remember to check.",2,-1
"great most of the time. paid annual membership on auto pay, they used an old card not set as primary payment method, thee card used was from a dormant account. I was charged an overdraft fee. called Amazon and the person I spoke to was less than helpful, rude, dismissive, non sympathetic, and hung up on me. she said amazone would not refund overdraft fee and that's how we do business. customer service is the worst I have ever dealt with.",2,-1
"No point in having this app as I am unable to purchase anything new and have to use the browser so they can comply with Google Play Store. Only option is to create lists, what a waste of time.",1,-1
"love you Amazon! However when we do returns we do not like using UPS or USP unless they pick up for free... also, don't like when seller makes you pay for returns. just an FYI. otherwise we love you!!!",5,1
We have moved a few times in the past  years due to my retirement and finding a home to buy. Amazon has been consistent in delivering timely purchases wherever I've been; in the city and now out in the county. They've been equally supportive of returns as a result of an issue with an order or an error in my own ordering.,5,1
Easy to shop. App makes it easy to chat and execute returns as well. Everything I need is one click away.,5,1
No good when searching for a part for your car and you get parts for other makes and models mixed in. I've had to spend more money because of buying from parts stores due to the frustration of searching for a part.,2,-1
"The convenience of finding whatever you want and having it delivered to your doorstep makes life a whole lot easier. I recommend this to all of my friends and family. Please make sure to READ all of the particulars such as Delivery Location, Payment Options, and Dates of Delivery. The returns process is really easy as well.",5,1
"Nice app, the numbers sometimes appear to be smaller and weird with the last two digits floating above the first two and inside my lists, it always lags and glitches when I slide up or down. Please fix these annoying issues.",4,-1
I really hate the fact that % of the merchandise sold on Amazon is made in China and made so cheaply that most times if you get to use it once or twice before it breaks your lucky but your even luckier if it works at all when it first gets to you!,4,-1
Amazon shopping is the best! They literally have everything you can possibly imagine at the touch of your fingertips. It barely takes a day or two for delivery. And making returns and exchanges is more simple than other online shopping apps I've used before.,5,1
Absolutely the best shopping experience ever. Fair price with free shipping. Ability to buy and free ship to friend and family's home addresses too. Game changer! A plus,5,1
The searches within this app are not accurate at all.. Example : I search for a product for adults and I make sure to be very specific.. At the top of my search list I see these products for children and not ADULTS like I searched for.. I can search for a certain product and the results I get has absolutely nothing to do with what I searched for.. Other than that the app is perfect..,3,-1
"Amazon shopping is that ""right from the convenience of your bed"" shopping that removes every hassle and limitation. Not to mention, shipping is easily facilitated through that ""front door drop off"" system! Can't you tell? I am a happy Amazon shopper !",5,1
every time I have ordered it has been prompt .And exactly what I ordered. Very pleased with Amazon Prime and all Amazon outlets,5,1
"Love ️ my Amazon account. I'm spoiled by online shopping convenience now by ordering from them for everything including clothes, shoes and pocketbooks!! You just can't beat the prices, convenience and you can always return and reorder sizes or styles cause they work will you and it is free to do this although I try to keep what I can. Thank you Amazon for being my shopping website of choice!! Thanks for bringing us great styles and our designers that we love ️   ️!!",5,1
"App is very slow, takes forever to sigh in and product pictures are slow and clunky to scroll, and not enough local products to support mostly seem to be from China as usual ! And finding exact product s can be unesasarily labour intensive. Other than those things in general you can find things with some ease, and whole payment process is smooth.",3,1
"Prices are getting too high. Getting to the point of cancelling Amazon all together for next year. Switch back to cable. Double charging ""paying members"" to watch new movies? way to take care of your customers. I used to love Amazon. Now your getting greedy like the rest of the world.",2,-1
"as a busy working mom and wife who suffers from multiple autoimmune issues, Amazon is amazing. from back braces to crafting stuff for school projects, I use this app frequently. Mama's best friend ",5,1
"Several charges made without my knowledge. I replaced my card and the same thing happened..last order was wrong size,wrong color,shopping at home a night mare for me.",1,-1
I do all my shopping on Amazon I love love it. Never had any issues. I will continue to keep shopping on Amazon.,5,1
"Scrolling has been broken for over a year now. I tried resetting everything, clearing cache, reinstalling, nothing helps. Trash.",1,-1
"BUYER BEWARE -- Returns only accepted now, not good for rural people who literally don't have access to a printer and aren't tech savvy. No loyalty/discounts for regular customers, just TV that you can find free. I also purchased new items that I received *used* (during covid) endless amounts of time, you would never see this in a TRUE business.. they are taking more and more money from us and we're expected to say nothing.. clearly taking advantage of everyone",1,-1
"Gotta love Amazon when they keep upping their subscription cost, but for years have failed to deliver packages the same week they said it would be delivered. Luckily I've learned to order time sensitive things on ebay as their constantly accurate on their deliveries.",2,-1
"Love love love Amazon!!! I don't know what I'd do without Amazon, I shop with them at least three times a week! Amazon Prime is soooo worth it, I have an Amazon Echo, Spot and Dot that I love, as well as Amazon Prime Video. There are so many reasons for getting Amazon Prime, free shipping is a great bonus, next day shipping is awesome. I can't recommend Amazon enough!!!! SO GREAT!!!!!",5,1
"Amazon let's me shop without the hassle of sales people. The reviews help me to make good choices and I can compare pricing, which in the last two years has become a MUST!",4,1
Amazon used to be my favorite shopping platform but it seems nowadays they are putting the interest of the company first rather that how convenient it is for people to use Amazon platform to buy and deliver free without prompting and inversely forcing them to sign up for prime deal to receive next day delivery. You now have to buy up to £ before you could qualify for a standard  days delivery. So utterly insane.,1,-1
"India support is useless, too many fake reviews, too many dishonest China sellers, Amazon is in a decline. I wouldn't be surprised if sales are in thier decline state.",1,-1
"Easy to Browse ,wide variety of choice in every department, Amazon Prime an added bonus if you have a subscription.",5,1
"best way to shop for baby products, clothing, household goods and appliances, appliances, etc. very rarely is there a mistake made, shipping is super fast and free with prime membership, and returns are super easy. Highly recommend!",5,1
the new app sucks tried to change the default list N it wont let me so it saves everything under  list which is the default list - this sucks uninstalling wont be buying from there,1,-1
"Amazon is the worst anymore. Yeah the app works and works well. Been a devoted prime member since the beginning. Amazon has gone down hill fast, two day prime shipping is week shipping at best since the pandemic. After  years of prime and  years of operating a business using Amazon supplies I can no longer rely on Amazon to get my business what it needs in time. They have dropped the ball on many crucial orders placed a week or more before I needed it in . Customer service is horrendous",1,-1
"Installed on-the-go to use inside an Amazon Fresh store (Southwark). Didn't want to verify my card and didn't let me scan the Fresh code. Useless. Went to Tesco instead. Also, you have to uninstall the whole thing to just log out!",1,-1
"Good place to shop. But in the country im with, only limited items are available. App is user friendly.",4,-1
Amazon is very good to order everything I need. Their products are great and always on time They also have a great return policy,5,1
"worth it on many items, and with amazon prime get free deliveries and special deals for a very low monthly price!",5,1
"Lists and downloads are a hassle! I use the app more than via my PC, and use it frequently throughout the day. As others have stated, Lists have become a pain in the neck over the past several months, if not longer. They frequently freeze, then bounce up and down as you try to get further down. And, I believe since the last update, suddenly I'm unable to download digital content for my Kindle! That's a BIG DEAL! Is that Amazon or Google causing this? Whichever, FIX IT! Play nice together.",3,1
"I love the fact, I can click, pay and it ship to my house. It is super convenient during covid time. But lately I not sure if it's worth to stay. App will falsely showing something available when it's out. Show acceptable delivery day, then change to further once purchased. Or showing me conflict info than when I call amazon customer service, which turns out both are semi incorrect.",3,1
This place is a scam! Don't buy items over $ cause they're always junk and break and then Amazon don't want to give replacement cause my item broke after  days! Non stop getting broken things in the mail or they break within  months! I'm now out of $ and a wedding ring set!,2,-1
Being disabled I've had to go through many challenges and not being able to walk much this is the best thing convenience and that they always have what I like and deliver with promptness thank you Amazon,5,1
"Amazing App, work's just as well as the desktop site. Very convenient, overall an excellent addition to Amazon services.",5,1
This apps make me sad because i oder samsung a g  day ago and they told me that they will deliever today but at day time they sent me mail that they can't deliever because of issue(not mention) and i check price of phone but they increase price of phone and make it more than .,1,-1
"Good way to shop Amazon, but the app would be much better if it offered the ability to open multiple tabs, and it was easier to share links to pages and objects in pre-existing social media threads (eg: allow copy/paste of links to items from the app, to any other app, in an intuitive way...something like a ""copy link"" button).",4,1
"I used to buy my groceries here. No more. Prices are up and most things I need to order are either out of stock (kidding, right? ), quantities are limited to  or  or, here's the kicker, you think you're gonna get it but ooops, it wasn't available after all and not in your delivery. If Amazon operated this way in the beginning they'd be a name of the past. They're taking their (dwindling) customer base for granted. Good bye Amazon. Hello, Walmart!",2,-1
"For the most part, Amazon is a great place to shop. It's convenient and Prime membership is a super calling card. I compare prices and more often than not, Amazon's prices are the best. I very much appreciate that Amazon offers Amazon Smile. It's a good feeling knowing that a donation is made to the charity of my choice on every product I buy. Customer Service has slipped a bit which can be annoying. All-in-all, I am a loyal Amazon Smile buyer!",5,1
"Amazons a convenient service that we all use, but I'm tired of the never ceasing issues. It's a common occurrence when I'm looking at home page deals, then the numbers swap. You cant add subscription items to cart or compare them. So as you view items for % off, suddenly they turn % off when you go back a page... Or i'll purchase one item, go back a minute later and the deals gone entirely. And then theres the obvious scam items with fake reviews for different items that you cant report.",3,1
"So far I'm in a weird area. And only a Bluetooth speaker is going to crush the weird place , so we will have to shed some PayPal lbs. And see what awaits...",5,1
"Recently started to automatically switch to French. Solution is to manually switch it back, or uninstall and install is easier. Decided to just uninstall for good. Even in English it is a PIA to try and find the language preferences in the app. It is easy to find in the web version but not the app.",1,-1
"I love shopping on Amazon. it's efficient, I can see lots of options for whatever I'm looking for and easy returns.",5,1
It says  day shipping with prime now says estimate shipping delivery times. I have had to cancel orders that were supposed to be two days and now say running late. Forgetabout!,1,-1
"I'm addicted. I buy nearly everything from Amazon now. Everything you want in a retailer and more. It's like having your own personal shopper but for everything. Also, the Prime Visa card is perfect as it gives options for %back or financing.",5,1
"being an Amazon employee I always get discounts, so that's always a plus on top of the one day and  day delivery. can't complain!",5,1
"prices are no longer competitive, never any stock of anything and no longer just a case of put in your details and buy things. it's all really overly complicated.",2,-1
"Convenient, super easy, great customer support, free delivery, so many options, always affordable!",5,1
"I love Amazon. Huge range, some excellent prices and often super quick delivery. Plus so simple!",5,1
They do everything in their power to make it impossible to get ahold of somebody and when you do it's still difficult somebody hacked my debit card and uses it to pay for their Amazon Prime now they need a bank statement with the transaction number on it so now I have to wait for the bank to open get a bank statement and jump through all these hoops just for them to do their job and I'm being falsely charged through their company,1,-1
"Recently, when I try to initiate a return, the QR code doesn't show up, just an empty box where code should be...I can go through my laptop, and print the code off, just won't show up in app.",1,-1
Excellent choices and plenty of options. No problem navigating throughout.,5,1
"My delivery instructions is set to always deliver to the back door of my house. But, that rarely happens. The delivery people need to do a better job. They are in such a rush, they don't bother checking. The UPS courier always does that, why can't the Prime drivers?",3,-1
Ud think Amazon wud be able to properly set my language settings to English and keep them that way. Keeps going to french every single time and their ' menus and sub menus labyrinth make it impossible to properly find a decent permanent fix to it. Even got lost trying to unsub from Prime. What is this?,1,-1
easiest and most convenient way to shop. prime has everything my household needs and for way better prices usually. Thanks Besos.,5,1
"Amazing 'App'...all the convenience & ease you want. BUT they (Amazon) have a very, very poor ""filters""! They (Amazon) overwhelm users with search results, and only have broad & generic filters by groups, etc. You end up just viewing the items that are 'Featured'. They should offer an 'advanced' way to search and filter.",3,-1
I do most of my shopping with Amazon due to the fact I live outside of the city and it's much more convenient to pick up packages at an Amazon Hub.,5,1
It's Amazon. This app is extremely convenient. Everything in the same place for your account. Always love Amazon to buy almost everything,5,1
When it comes to redeeming my money it only given  options. I'd like to set up direct deposit but it wants to verify my identity. You can only do this from the app and when it co mes to taking a picture on of the backside it won't work.,2,-1
Their customer service is amazing! One of my items ended up getting stolen and when I called the customer service they were so kind! I explained my situation and they gave me a full refund with no hassel. I am so thankful and give their customer service  stars (if possible).,4,1
I love Amazon shopping! They always have just what I need and at great prices and free shipping too!,5,1
"Amazing array of products to choose from, easy to add or remove items from your cart, and hassle free checkout. The shipping rate/speed is the only issue that I continue to have.",4,-1
App keeps switching itself to Spanish!! Why? I haven't shared my login with anyone. At first it was just my order history page but everything else was in English. But now it keeps going to Spanish. Please fix it!,2,-1
Quick convenient and in my opinion very well priced especially considering they deliver these things straight to your door! Very handy when ordering a household appliance or furniture and you don't have a truck. I love Amazon shopping! ️,5,1
"useful but not everything is what it says. for every quality item, there's  cheap knockoffs. otherwise it's fast and easy to use",4,1
"I love being able to order items and have them arrive at my door within a day or two. It is amazingly convenient and saves so much time! I get overwhelmed by the noise and constant motion of stores, so Amazon is a wonderful app for me.",5,1
"I love shopping on Amazon, they have everything I'm looking for, and not looking for, even retro items. I'm always impressed.",5,1
"When I paid for Amazon prime before, it was supposed to be so I would receive my orders fairly quickly. No longer the case with Amazon. Also, so many of my orders being shipped to me are used item's. I've paid for a new product, yet they've shipped opened and used item's to me several times.",2,-1
First experience I have ever had with a nap. Why the hell I loaded this damn thing I don't know. I was wanting to purchase some stuff but you can't purchase nothing. Something always happens on your end and it crashes. Don't waste your time loading this app. Amazon sucks,1,-1
"This app needs some work. I always have to click the Prime button to while I am browsing. If I am signed in under my profile, I shouldn't have to make sure it is clicked on. Also the app should function like the actual website. Uninstalling this app.",1,-1
App always works great and has not crashed a single time. I don't think I have seen any bugs yet!!,5,1
"Majority of results will first have to be weeded out from ads. Terrible sitting options. Will even omit results once a sort field is applied. Things like books will have completely copied descriptions, with no reviews, and no option to ask the seller questions. Does not give query options in search; how this app became #, I will never know.",1,-1
"all in all ive been pleased with the quality of my purchases. customer service has been super great, especially regarding returns and how easy it is. all i have to warn about is signing on for the  step verification. i lost my phone therefore had no way to answer their text and for the life of me could NOT get past it! customer support even told me i would have to make a new account! i eventually got my phone back. no joke when protecting our accounts! ",5,1
Terrible service system has a glitch never let me look at my account.  times since I tried ordering and it's impossible. Also having a hard time closing my account,1,-1
"Excellent shopping experience, you could probably purchase anything you are looking for, variety of quality to choose from, and the delivery is always super fast, on top of that the return is unquestionably easy and free if the item you received is not as good as described or something wrong with it, try Amazon, you will love it.",5,1
"If it where possible to not give any stars at all them i wouldn't give them any. So Amazon actually dupes people if it didn't happen to me personally i wouldn't have believed, for the past  months i haven't received any response from Amazon app team after blocking my account for suspicious transactions till now i haven't gotten my money back and what I ordered has still not arrived please if your gonna order anything outside your countries Amazon don't these people will take your money for not.",1,-1
This app is in need of a total overhaul. Not just updates. Totally make it more customer friendly. I use to get text notifications regarding my deliveries. Updates are not good anymore. Missing a lot,1,-1
"I REALLY REALLY REALLY need help. I am putting a text on a shirt and when I put the text in the middle, it puts in the corner instead. Can somebody help me fix it please. It's bothering me and Amazon contact can't help me. Does anybody know what to do? Contact me",5,1
So frustrated!! I've never had problems with this app till now. I can't purchase kindle books in app anymore and I want this fixed!!,1,-1
"I've been shopping with Amazon for years now. Man,I still love this place. I can't get out so it's like shopping at the mall for me, YEAAH. Thankyou everyone that makes it possible to get such Great merch., and Really SUPER GOOD prices. Have a Great day... Patrick",5,1
"Prime, I pay for prime to get the fastest delivery. Which was amazing back in - but then covid hit and understandably deliveries took longer. Well that craps over and Prime is still lacking greatly. Step it up for a better rating!",3,-1
"Horrible. I lost  dollars from this app. Without receiving, this happened twice. I do give it some credit though. When I first started ordering it went fine. Then I ordered two things and the app said I never ordered the stuff that I did order. And it also proceed to keep my money. I tried contacting them but they said they couldn't do anything.",2,-1
"No customer support. They raised the membership price, took away customer chat feature. Used the callback feature... The phone rings but no one on the other side. This company has grown too big for its own good. It's high time for a competitor to take market share and bring the AMZN stock price down.",1,-1
Excellent selections with extremely fast Prime deliveries. Also very easy to order from previous purchase history.,5,1
GR!!iBeen using the Amazon app all of the time day_ night  never a problem at all. Easy to return mainly clothing. Never mind !Amazon is the best choice for us I recommend for anything you want to buy,5,1
love the app but hate these ways of payment I say this cause I'll pay for a item say monday an it will be pending then double charged why not take the money when the purchase button is hit not a week later cause all my stuff on auto pay so it takes when due but Amazon has like  diff ways they charge  for having prime  for the item. then chagered separately for delivery an then chagered the item price.,4,-1
"Fast almost faultless service. occasionally items are damaged, especially books. Independent booksellers take better care. Also, very rarely wrong size item is sent.",4,1
Lately I can not get my past orders to load. I can't see when my stuff is arriving. I have to go to the website to get the info. Very inconvenient,2,-1
I uploaded a code to get $ and it said it was loaded on my account successfully but in the checkout it's not allowing me to pay for my item and saying that there was a problem and to please add a payment method when I have one. Please help.,2,-1
")Please respond to the customer whenever they email you with a problem. )FIX YOUR APP!! IT IS FAILING!! I use this app all the time. This past  weeks I keep getting the ""OOPS! SOMETHING WENT WRONG."" notification whenever I try to get into it to check on my upcoming deliveries, Account information or even search. I've uninstalled and reinstalled.",1,-1
"This app used to run efficiently and now i can't even shop in peace for  seconds! A dog keeps showing up with a message below saying ""oops...something went wrong"". It's highly aggravating. I tried reinstalling it only for the app not even LAUNCH now. RIDICULOUS!",2,-1
"I love Amazon!! I literally buy everything from Amazon because they have great prices, quick shipping, and their customer service is nd to none!!",5,1
One awesome way to get what you need. I have no issues with Amazon but Good things about the way Amazon treats me. I am Very pleased with the shipping information and time. I would definitely recommend it. The Amazon way of saving your day and Money is the best.,5,1
"I shop here all the time. A person can look up absolutely anything, research it, and make an educated purchase. It removes the impulsive shopping at a public retail store. people can concentrate on each item and with Prime it is shipped FREE (kinda because there is a membership fee) in a couple of days. I am out of town a lot and use the lockers ALL the time. The lockers are at a convenience store and some items delivered to the locker are a fraction of the price it is in that store.",5,1
"I can't believe how easy to shop and much cheaper than island I live on. The membership gives me free shipping , which nowadays every penny counts! Delivery straight to my front door. But, lately my boxes have come in shambles, boxes broken or smashed. Like it has been thrown around a lot. But, so far nothing has broken. Shopping at Amazon has been a blessing. I have told all my friends and family to use Amazon as well. Although I would love to shop locally. Money doesn't go far these days.",5,1
"I am still new with Amazon, I have had my product on time so far,  item I have returned was successfull(return not faulty product , it was not adequatefor my purpose & have purchaseda replacement). There was  item the product picture was maliciously changed however ccominucating with Amazon customer service & the supplier the item shipped is the item I ordered. package not here yet but was happy with customer service from Amazon & product supplier/vendor.",4,1
"Used to be great. Have  firesticks,  k stick and  cube. Used to be able to do what you wanted load apps add apps you pay for. Now seems they are stripping away as much as they can and force thier will on me.  day shipping lol i havent gotten that lie in over a year.",3,1
I enjoy Amazon a lot. only problem I had was over charged almost $ for an order I didn't order waiting on refund still....,4,-1
quick and easy purchases. only have issue with rd party vendors not all the time though.,5,1
"The app can't open ""My page"" and ""others"" section, so basically two of the four buttons at the bottom bar is totally useless. So what's the point of using the app then? Browser is even better on the mobile than the app. Only using the app for promotion codes unfortunately.",2,-1
"Easy to tap to download items to buy. You tap on item you like it shows prices, sizes available. Like online shopping my first with Amazon. Like the choices. Ty",5,1
"UI is terrible, app is laggy. Gotta traverse  different pages just to get to things like previous orders, or order tracking.",3,-1
I truly appreciate Amazon Prime's big benefits for such a small monthly price. I get free shipping on everything I order and they have an Amazon free delivery and pickup locker at a Quick trip close to where I live. I don't worry about packages sitting on my front porch and I can pick them up when I get off work. Actually makes life a little less stressful. Thanks Amazon!,5,1
"Amazingly easy to find exactly what I want, fast shipping, and easy to make returns!",5,1
"love the app, can be frustrating at times, and when the layout changes can be hard to find stuff wish that prime devices integration was better.",5,1
really good if you have prime because your items might come sooner if it allows prime to be used. there's alot of items to buy but sometimes it's a rip off some items you find for  are probably about  to  however you can also find cheap items it's all about the time you put into searching,5,1
Some good and some bad with this app more good than I can say then bad. In fact I'll be switching from wish over to this app because I've gotten a lot more feedback from customer service and help then I have with wish ever.,3,1
I've used the Amazon app since way back when I had a Windows phone. And through all the changes I've never had a big issue. But now we can't buy digital content on the app anymore. What's the point of even having the app if I can't purchase the one thing I spent the most on. (Kindle books) Please fix this.,1,-1
It's very easy to shop on this app. Navigating the app is easy as    and it almost never crashes. I can't find anything bad to say about this app. I've never had any issues with it. excellent customer service. Smooth return process. Therefore i keep shopping here.,5,1
Amazon have now decided to include videos. I find these annoying to the point the app has become unusable. I also find myself scrolling through pages off irrelevant sponsored results when searching for an item. I give up.,1,-1
"Have used this application for years and normally always enjoy the simple design. Occasionally, Amazon makes changes to format and customers have to adjust. Overall, the application makes it easy to buy and return items. My only objections is I believe Amazon allows false reviews that favor the product.",5,1
"Not only have they taken away the ability to buy ebooks in app, they now refuse to show any kindle prices at all. Instead they claim under the kindle unlimited banner ""available instantly for free"". But wait I first have to wishlist it, to then find it again on the web browser. Only then it will show up with an actual cost for the ebook. Some books are actually free, and I don't understand why refuse to state the prices. They already restricted the purchases in app, was that not enough?",1,-1
"Multiple times I have ordered something and it says one date but as soon as it says ""shipped"" the delivery date changes drastically. I've had to cancel orders because of this. Amazon prime wasn't like this before, not sure what changed since you all seem to be improving everything",4,1
"A very useful and straightforward app. Makes ordering a breeze. Bad for my debit card, good for everything else. Lol! Visually engaging and well laid out app. Big free, smooth and fast. Excellent!",5,1
Always delivered in time range to my door. Easy return. Reading all prior other will help your satisfaction. Option for used items has saved for unopened items ! Gas charge built into costs. New way of life ay $ gallon.,5,1
every order has been smooth sailing but I have my cousin look at the products before ordering. the younger generation is better at knowing the legitimate products.,5,1
"The app has been running slow and has a delayed response. For the last + months I have been unable to access my orders. The screen never loads or it says oops something went wrong..... It is not the internet connection, it is the app.",2,-1
I love Amazon shopping most of the time you get it's next working day and if there any problem you just send it back for a full refund not like ebay where you have to open a Case and wait so many days for your money back. + plus Amazon,5,1
"I have a United States credit card, billing and shipping address and the app wanted to charge me $. for shipping (I was eligible for and selected free shipping on check out) then it was defaulting to a foreign currency. I spent $ worth of my time being switched from one person to the next. What's happening with Amazon?",1,-1
Good app. but the search engine is not always helpful as it's difficult to narrow ones search.,4,-1
love Amazon due to the options they offer alone with good price and availability. It's an ease to return items and it makes shopping so much easier and more pleasurable,5,1
Awesome for people who cannot get out and shop. I have received a shirt that was unfinished. A product of lo quality. And ex large that came in small with the bag marked.extra large. But I don't expect perfection. Love my Amazon,5,1
"Good products, good secure payment system in place. Flexible in delivery/payment and invoice etc. its Amazon... what are you expecting?",5,1
"Amazon, my safe haven to get anything QUALITY at anytime at amazing prices and fast service. I can't do without AMAZON!  keep up the good work. You're the best.",5,1
BEST PRICES!!! I have bought items from Amazon that cost  TIMES MORE AT OTHER FASHION OUTLETS!!! BRAS from D store were $. Amazon $. SAME BRA!!! From D I paid $ for . Amazon  for $!!!! JUST IN CASE YOU LIKE BIG NAME STORE? GIVE AMAZON YOUR BUSINESS AND SAVE BIG!!,5,1
"This used to be a good app, but for some reason it says I can now not purchase digital music via the app from my phone or tablet, when I could at the start of April. So I have to log in on the website instead. All other purchases work fine on the App. I updated the app and it makes no difference.",1,-1
"very old clunky app,needs to upgrade a bit to keep up with it's competitors, who do it a lot better,also needs to separate it's oz and American markets, makes it too confusing trying to work out where somthing is coming from,and working out the exchange rates and postage rates,if you have an australian store,then sell the product in australia,,don't send it from usa,or China,???",2,-1
"I have had quite a few issues lately trying to order. My main problem was Amazon running my card before I wanted to check out. They ran my card  times, and I was unable to cancel my order.",3,1
"absolutely love how Amazon has almost everything..... fast delivery as well. good deals too. some things are cheaper,,, but not all. the music part of Amazon prime sucks... definitely not worth it.",5,1
I don't know what happened but I can't download single mp's anymore. I keep getting a message that says (This device is not authorized to receive mp's). Very frustrating as I have downloaded lots of music in the past.,1,-1
"I love shopping Amazon. The app include very detailed information of all the products, seller, Prime availability and about anything else you would need to know. The prices are definitely more affordable than most of any other retailers local or online. Amazon regular prices are less than even sale prices with other retailers. I am buying more products through Amazon due to inflated prices every where else. You won't find a better company than Amazon.",5,1
This app over the last year or two has become extremely laggy and stuttery. It's barely useable and it's honestly pathetic from such a large company. I don't have this issue with other shopping apps I use and this app runs the worse out of all the apps on my phone. Ordering an item or adding something to a list is obnoxious and it's easier to pull out my laptop to use rather than to use this app even if I'm already on my phone.,1,-1
"The loading times are the only problem, but not too much of a hassle, other than that, great app amazon!",4,1
"Amazon shopping is very easy. I have lots of shopping apps but Amazon is always my preferred choice due to most of the items being of a certain high quality. And I usually find what I'm looking for on Amazon. Also, shipping is still faster here than any other app that I'm currently using right now, even if I'm not using prime membership.",4,1
"This app is going downhill fast. First, there was the overcomplicating of moving from menu to menu, lack of options to help search. Now I can't even view my orders!! What the heck?!",2,-1
"The convenience and simplicity, making shopping so easy. Which can be a bad thing at times lol, I've never spent so much money before with so little effort.",5,1
"Meh. I've had a giftcard for something like  months. When I try and find something to use it for I'm lost in a sea of cheap China products with fake reviews. Many are realizing the decline of Amazon quality. I wish there was an ""American Made"" filter so we could shop local.",1,-1
"The new interface is horrible and slow. On top of that, it doesn't notify me when the delivery partner screws up and misses the delivery by date. This is a feature I have been requesting for years, not alexa integration, not other ""features"" that show down the experience. My concerns are still valid as of /,and why am I seeing ads!?",1,-1
I love shopping through Amazon. I can find everything I need and have delivered quickly. I can't find a better shopping experiance. I have been shopping through Amazon for over  years.,5,1
"Love the Amazon shopping app it is so helpful when searching certain items, gives the best prices on items and helps with tracking orders and shipping",5,1
"Can't buy digital content through app anymore? Amazon is evil, like truly, these are very malignant, greedy people running the show. But, we all put up with it for our own convenience, which is obviously just wrong. I for one am done. See ya.",1,-1
The Amazon app went from easy to absolute trash within the last update. I no longer have the ability to see my previous orders. The app constantly states that something went wrong while searching. I basically have to go back to my laptop or my tower in order to find any information. This update is horrible,2,-1
Too many counterfeit products. You really have to read reviews and hope for the best you get a legit product.,3,1
"Delete Alexa. I no longer use Alexa but the app has strategically placed the stupid floating Alexa button where most people scroll and I constantly hit it by accident. I should be able to disable this button and make it disappear. But no...that would be I would control my device, not Amazon. Very frustrating",1,-1
"I shop with Amazon for almost everything now. It's perfect for all Christmas and birthday gifts, for treats and for all of my craft projects. I have never had any problems with returning items, whether damaged/faulty or just no longer needed. Excellent service all round.",5,1
"Since I can no longer apparently buy books from this app to read on my Kindle app (I'm sure because of a rev sharing dispute between Amazon and Google), I will use this opportunity to buy from the publisher and funnel to my Kindle. In no way am I navigating to a desktop browser to buy a book.",1,-1
"This app used to run flawlessly and with speed, but for the past month or so, it's extremely slow, constantly halts between actions, images take forever to load and then they load blurry and freezes for like  seconds before the images become clear and you can scroll between images. They need to fix this app! I'm on hear multiple times a day and purchase from them several times a week and this slowness and freezing is HORRIBLE! And it's not my internet connection nor my phone!",1,-1
"I basically live for this app. Household and home, to cute tops and shoes, it's perfect for the hard working person who doesn't have time to go shopping for everyday items.",5,1
"Easy to use, bad for shopping addiction lol. Honestly the app has been such a time saver. Love it. Especially the tracking features.",5,1
What happened to this app? It keeps freezing since the last update. Very frustrating. I cant complete searches for what I need.,2,-1
"Absolute trash now. Throwing out book ratings and reviews, and doesn't allow ebook purchases. Just use your browser now, they've made the app pointless.",1,-1
I tried to order some stuff like some corsets and some tops from Amazon it actually said please submit a Amazon document below to verify that you were authorized to use this kind of payment method that I have used on my most recent order and I can't order any stuff. I don't have an Amazon billing statement they have been putting a hold onto my Amazon account,2,-1
"I buy everything here, I'm a shopoholic. the only reason I gave  stars is due to the amount of ads that this app have. most of the products are based on how much the company pays for be in the front page. you just need to be smart enough to understand how it works and make good judgment on what products really are good vs what the app suggest you. same with the reviews.",4,-1
"A hacker changed my mailing info and billing info...amazon won't let me into account since I can't verify billing address, or send me a security form, ""you need access to amazon to do all their forms..."" (your account was found safe by Amazon's team, related to the hackers.. ) soo I just canceled and refunded all transactions since I have no access to my own account. ‍️. This will be a class action lawsuit one day in America.",1,-1
"If I could give it  stars I would. My Amazon account has been locked since December, when I got a bunch of Amazon gift cards and i got  and when I placed an order, I tried the first one, I spent it all, no worries I try the second one also nothing,  same thing, and I go to do the fourth and it says ""your account has been locked due to suspicious activity"". So I contacted Amazon immediately and it's APRIL now and my account is still locked",1,-1
I would give Amazon  stars but my packages  keep going to my next door  neighbor  for some reason every time and some I never receive back but other than that THEIR AWESOME!!!️ Keep up the good work and continue helping others become in a position of power of success. Lol I sound like a guest speaker and I've never even work there but heard good things.,4,-1
Amazing shopping at Amazon. whatever you want to buy you will perfectly get here and that within one day delivery. Also if nothing gets around the local stores you get here at Amazon. Fastest delivery and affordable prices. Best service till date and never had issues. You must try and always go for Amazon.,5,1
"I usually do not enjoy shopping. I love to shop on Amazon. I don't have to ""get ready"" or go anywhere. My purchase just arrives. This is delightful in my opinion.",5,1
"It's a struggle. I don't really want to buy from you, but I do. Receiving those orders seems to be hit or miss lately though.",3,-1
"Nothing ever loads since the last update. The only thing I get to see now is ""UH OH Something went wrong on our end."" I can't search for items, I can't browse, the app is useless now. The only upside is the cute picture of a sad dog that accompanies the message error.",1,-1
"I love my Amazon prime. For only a few dollars I get my deliveries within  days and free, prime tv, prime music and the list goes on. Prime does not disappointment.",5,1
Amazon app for phones is great for on the go shopping. Love the convenience but much prefer the full scale desktop app.,4,1
"Amazon is fair place to do business and purchases...at this point...if you are paying attention to was going on in this country and across the world, that could easily change over night, but I like I said is good place for great deal at this time.",4,1
"Good timing, fast, high quality things plus you even get a  day free trial and you can cancel it any time, I highly recommend this app it is the best out there",5,1
"Love the app but it's bright on my eyes when browsing, a dark theme for this app would be amazing ..dark theme means more browsing...let's make the dark theme happen... then I'll rate it  stars..",3,-1
I prefer the website. I feel like I'm missing a broader selection and it seems like the app is designed for impulse purchasing... I prefer to read all the details and have more than  or  products visible on my screen at one time.,2,-1
I love the Amazon Shopping App! It's way too easy to spend money on it. very easy and convenient with massive selection..,5,1
Lately it's horrible made any shopping in this app: it took my money very times an nothing! I was watting and the status never change. And my money never gone back and the costumer service is awful,1,-1
Tired of opening up the app and being asked to get Prime! Tired of down loading the app. You should feel the need to fix something that's not broken,1,-1
"Their is only delivery instructions for business accounts I live in a locked building all you have to do is knock you get in or even look at the door the right way an they let you in but they keep going oh its locked let's not knock an see if we can get in and just deliver ""later"" instead, because I'm really sure it is polite to deliver ""later"" rather than sooner... excellent services",1,-1
"Why am I paying for  day prime shipping? My deliveries are frequently  DAYS LATE! I talked to USPS who informed me that amazon shipments are just regular mail. They are not expedited shipping so its all about how fast USPS wants to deliver it, has nothing to do with paying extra for PRIME!!!! Ebay is more dependable, at least their tracking information is accurate.",1,-1
Continue to have the app language switch from English to Spanish automatically out of nowhere. Language is set on English but still gives notifications in Spanish. I tried to uninstall the app and reinstall also tried to clear cache but the problem still isn't fixed. Very very frustrating,2,-1
"I honestly have mixed feelings on using this App & Amazon as a whole. Their prices are all over the place & they push you to buy from Amazon. Prices aren't usually the cheapest, with browsers now able to show lower prices & local availability, you can see the cost differences. They move delivery dates based on your other orders so they can save on shipping, so don't be surprised when it arrives days after you needed it. Delivery with UPS is properly delivered however USPS puts it out front.",3,1
"Great but..... Amazon, please, for the love of all that is good, GET RID OF THE VIBRATION WHEN YOU ADD TO CART!!!! If that wasn't an issue I'd probably give  stars, as let's face it, if Amazon haven't got it do you need it? I also wish it would be clearer to show where some of the items come from as there is some nasty cheap imitations on there (generally from China) which I'd rather not have",4,-1
"I love the Prime services which gives me free fast delivery on my purchases. Amazon also has great deals!, I am rarely unhappy with items I buy here and the app adds so much convenience.",5,1
"I generally like the app, it's quick and easy to figure out. However the last few times I've tried to look at my lists, it won't let me scroll down. The screen just jumps back up each time I try to look down through my wish lists.",3,1
"The app never loads. I can't purchase anything. I always get a ""oops something went wrong"" dog picture. This app worked fine one week ago before I got my new phone. Now it barely works. I hate it.",1,-1
"Easy and convenient. I can do, pretty much, everything in the app that I need to do on the web site. One of the best apps overall.",5,1
my favourite place to shop. they gave everything from plugs to a new outfit. the vest shopping experience I and my husband could ever wish for. thank you Amazon for great products at great prices.,5,1
love using it but the delivery drivers keep messing up my flowers and delivering to the wrong door and set my packages where they are easily seen from the street as well as putting small deliveries in my mailbox which is totally ILLEGAL. I've made several reviews and have clear instructions on where to put packages but they ignore it so they can deliver faster.,1,-1
"The app is very easy to navigate and you can get some great bargains. but beware, there are some dodgy sellers out there. if the item is way too cheap. then it is too good to be true .",5,1
Great app but sometimes when you specify ask for an item it puts in additional items that look a lot like what your looking for but not quite right so u have to send back,4,-1
"Bezos you got more money than you could ever hope to spend, let alone need. Use some of that egregious wealth to make an app that actually works well, because this sure doesn't.",1,-1
It's too convenient. So good it's altering humanity into a different species altogether. Anything under the sun at the tip of your fingers then to your doorstep.,5,1
What the heck Amazon? Like other have said it was fine until your last update. Now I can barely shop without the app struggling to load and crashing multiple times.,1,-1
Lately the delivery sucks for what one pays for prime its really not worth it I'm going to cancel soon things don't even get delivered by them but by every other carrier so that being said it's not even the pandemic anymore just bad service over all never ship on time even if it's in your own city,1,-1
"I am so in love with Amazon. Seriously the prices for most things I buy are definitely cheaper. I will always shop with Amazon. He started out small and grew huge, and that's because of the prices.",5,1
Why do we have to go through the browser to buy stuff for the kindle app now? Bit ridiculous to go that extra step. Also the scrolling through wishlists is still messing up. It'll go down a short way it freezes than when you get it working again it goes down sometimes a dozen items down the list so you have to scroll back up and repeat process. You can't cancel digital orders through the app either for some reason,2,-1
Amazon clearly makes it easier to keep up-to-date with all your household and work items. They are the assistant I need.,5,1
"Horrible Customer Service! I have a login problem, and the ""representative"" I spoke to was very rude, and kept talking over me while I was trying explain the problem I'm having. That's not good customer service.",1,-1
"I appreciate Amazon and their efforts, however their Search Engine can use a LOT of improvement... I developed a Intuitive Search Algorithm for the company I currently work for. It works like a charm!!! Cheers guys! Best Regards, Randy",5,1
always great prices and quality products. I've been using Amazon prime for three yrs now no problems. would reccomend amazon. quick delivery too.,5,1
With Amazon Prime I get the things I need with no shipping charge and no minimum. I love shopping on Amazon. I find so many items that I love.,5,1
"Amazon is amazing! I can find everything that I need in one place and good prices.(edit) since the last update app is not responding well, also not updating with shipping details. This needs fixed pronto!",2,-1
App will not allow me to go to look at my orders. Keeps giving an error. It also is not allowing me to check gift balance. Dies not show update needed. Really needs bugs fixed badly!,1,-1
"Try before you buy is honestly the one thing that made buying parts like from home depot or ye old RadioShack possible. And it's normal for brick and mortar store to accept returns even up to  days at Walmart. I preferred the flexibility of usps and FedEx but I guess switching to ups exclusively isn't so bad. Pro tip, if you live in a major city print out the label and just memorize when the truck comes by. The driver will take any labeled package. Saves everyone a trip",5,1
I've been using Amazon for a while now but earlier when I tried to use my gift card balance to pay for my items it's been forcing me to use affirm as a payment method WHICH I DON'T WANT!? It doesn't allow me to take if off and only wants me to use affirm.,1,-1
I love Amazon Prime. I don't know where I'd be with out fast shipping and reasonable prices. Best place to shop where ever when ever!! Keep up the good work Amazon!!!,5,1
"Several useless recomendations that make navagation difficult. If you buy a dashcamera or a vaccum, you only need one, but you will be bombarded with all kinds of different ones after you buy one. Zero control over anything.",1,-1
Amazon has been a time and money saver for me. I have no time to go shopping so Amazon has been the most amazing tool for my busy schedule.,5,1
"Amazon makes shopping very easy. I very much appreciate how they stand behind every order. Almost all sellers are very reputable. Occasionally, not often, a seller may make a return difficult. Amazon takes care of that right away. it took me a long time to get here, I am glad I finally did!",5,1
"I love Amazon. I have never had a problem with returns or anything else. I also like that with Prime, the shipments arrive so quickly.",5,1
"Amazon Egypt, very poor service, they requesting to receive the money before handing the order over!! They not allowing you to check what are you going to pay before paying!! It could be the wrong order, it could be the wrong colour, it could be broken!! Very poor service and decided not to use it anymore!",1,-1
"unique items, Amazon usually has them. special batteries, appliance light bulbs, a special fastener. thank you Amazon for the great service.",4,1
"I love using the app but some of the items are damaged when u get it , then you have to return then order again .........a big waist of time. But overall I love the app",4,1
I have always loved this app but now I am unable to purchase kindle books via the app but have to use my browser. Don't see the point in having the app anymore,1,-1
"So I'm a little bit upset at Prime. This is the nd time in  months that y'all have lost my package. I don't understand why it's so hard to get a package from one local city to another. I'm still gonna use Prime, but this is crazy.",2,-1
The moment I installed this app I've been incessantly inundated by scam emails. Its the only thing I use that particular email for and have never had a problem until I installed the app. Make sure whatever email you use with amazon is only used for that purpose. Their security on this app is garbage.,1,-1
"Been in love with Amazon for years! please believe all the hype...any issues that I may have are always solved pretty much right away. Some of the prices on certain things could definitely be lower, but I'm still obsessed",5,1
Everything is good but I needed to change from French to English & was impossible. So had to delete it. So trying to install & reset.,5,1
"Unable to get customer service help!!!! I've tried to use the app for questions on returns of products. It keeps saying chat ""hit a snag"" so I click on call me, enter my number, & it t says ""technical difficulties"" right now. It's good on for several days now. I finally found a toll free number but then they ask for email or phone number before even getting started & said nothings wrong with call me back in customer service and I should just login again. Yet.... the app let me make a purchase",1,-1
Just call me the Amazon Queen! I always check prices here first its easy and convienent plus they deliver and thats a definte  thumbs up. I'm paraplegic with no transportaton so I need this. U know they have monopolized the market but I love it,5,1
"shopping with amazon is just so easy! I always find what I want and have lots of comparisons in stocks to find the right price for your purchase, it's my go to shopping centre! all in one place. so convenient and trustworthy. never had a problem with returns. totally devoted customer.",5,1
"I can shop / when the need arises. I can even find parts for my  Chevy truck I'm rebuilding. I am especially grateful for having the ability to send last minute gifts anywhere in the country, and you store soooo many mailing addresses, so I don't have to look them up each time. I am a fan!",5,1
"Easiest way to order the various items that you want and at the right price that you want, some items arrive at your doorstep in days and many arrive the next day or same day. When you get something you don't like you have a grace period from which you can get an exchange or refund. Delivery is also discreet and followed to your specifications and almost everytime arrived just in time.",5,1
"The app is good however I do have a bit of criticism, the app is waaay to bright! I highly suggest adding a dark mode. It would improve it cause you guys have so much tech advancements like everyone else however your the only one who lacks a simple dark mode for your viewers eyes.",2,-1
"When I search for a price range or search price low to high, the results are littered with random higher prices to the point it's impossible to search for what you want.",2,-1
"The service is excellent but the app is not that good, I expected more from a giant, I'd love a DARK MODE, more options on editing my lists, a better and more minimal design as app options tend to be so complicated and in order to navigate to specific menus is just a mess, search is not that precise, I'd love the same option of moving items from your list like the web version please, it would be great to add more space in details on your delivery options.",2,1
"Chat support continuously closes on its own. We had to reopen the chat four times until we finally resolved our order issue. The app is hard to navigate. It's easier to navigate through the website than the app, which should be simpler.",1,-1
"App was good till ""SNAP EBT Eligible"" disappeared from product descriptions! Not worth the time shopping for food if unlabeled for SNAP EBT. VERY UNHAPPY!! // Okay, glitch is fixed. Happy again. Thanks.",4,-1
"Have had, and been using, the app for a few years now. Easy to navigate and filter/sort searches as needed. Able to get to and from cart and liste easily. No lag issues and no forced closes.",5,1
"Amazon regularly advertises a delivery date they know they cannot meet to fet a sale. They will then promise a refund in  days when you cancel the order. If they get the item in stock before they send the refund they will ship the item anyway and claim you never canceled the order(even though you have a cancellation email, the app showed the order was cancelled, and the web site showed the order was cancelled). Their business model is built upon false advertising and deceptive practices.",1,-1
"Can't set to nitght mode. I have trouble seeing, the white background, so its hard to see.",3,1
You can't search for specific items using ””. The search is trash. Google it first and then go to the Amazon page. You'll get lots of updates for cheap items you ordered and where they are. Anything expensive...lol...,3,-1
They place wrong information when a package is going to be delivered. Needs better details on tracking a package the drivers need WAY better delivering skills. Such as not just to throw the pack over the front door to enter the property.,1,-1
"of course I love shopping on Amazon ... that's what my order history seems to indicate anyways ;-) but yeah I really do, it could be an addiction problem but I'm ok with it either way lol",5,1
"I love shopping with Amazon they have soooo many different options on gifts, clothes and more. when I can't find it in the store and last minute gifts. Amazon is the best and there service is Great.",5,1
Doesn't work with Galaxy Tab . I use Amazon Smile on my desktop but can't activate it here. Screen just loads and loads forever.,3,1
have been able to solve any issue with one except from a store selling through site. However any time I had a problem and chatted with Amazon staff things have been taken care of. Amazon having chat as an option is GREATLY IMPORTANT AND APPRECIATED for one reason I have social anxiety and trying to address things on the phone is extremely intimating. just making appointments can take hours to talk myself into. So again I appreciate this option.,5,1
Good products. Prime delivery is Excellent. I am Amazon big fan because sitting at home can do any shopping and compare prices. Very convenient. I would recommend anyone for Amazon shopping and Prime Delivery £. a month and free delivery annually.,5,1
"Amazon could stand to improve buyer protection, looking out for Amazon customers better -in terms of false advertising by sellers and ease of returns.",4,-1
"My app now defaults to prime shipping off and the search function is terrible when looking up specific vehicle parts. I primarily use it for auto parts and supplies, and often times searches never bring you close to what you want/need...",1,-1
"really good services on time prices is a bit higher then at another retailers, but you got really working returns, really good protections and fast delivery. finnaly you are more protected then another providers",5,1
"It's fast, works well and does what it's sopposed to, but it needs work here on Android. A lot of things are outdated or unstable in some way. Opening links, for instance, is still spotty and clunky.",3,1
"Love shopping Amazon, one click and your stuff is on the porch sometimes the next day. I would rather shop online than go into the store.",5,1
"I'm thinking there isn't a day that I don't go using this app to purchase things we want or need! SO convenient, efficient and fast!",5,1
".... if you ever need information from 'customer service' such as how to contact a seller directly, good luck with that, most of their 'customer service' are inept. I needed contact info for a soundbar and they sent me a link for a pizza joint. (truth!)",3,-1
I can find most products I need at a competitive price and usually cheaper. The short delivery times and the return process are really good,5,1
"I wasn't sure if I would like the Amazon app because I was used to the web page. However, I have adjusted and really like the simpler design.",5,1
Remember when you could buy music on Amazon? Well guess what kids?! You get to pay for a subscription just to be able to even buy music now. Amazon is so stupid. I am canceling my prime membership.,1,-1
"Funny how now that I want to cancel my prime membership I cannot do so in the app. When I go to ""manage my membership"" it loops around and keeps taking me to the ""explore my benefits page"" fix your app and stop trying to trap people in your subscription by making it inconvenient to cancel",1,-1
"I wish I could give it less than  star. I like shopping on Amazon, but their app is absolutely horendous and Soo frustrating! I can't even look at it for an entire single minute without it freezing up or getting kicked off. For the life of me, I can't understand WHY these Billion dollar companies refuse to hire app developers who know what they're doing. What money they saved in cheap app development will be lost anyways bc customers Can't shop on their app. FIX YOUR APP! This is ridiculous!",1,-1
No longer able to buy ebooks from the app. So if anyone is thinking of downloading to buy ebooks as the zon is easier than searching kindle store dont bother.,1,-1
"works really well except that it needs an exit button as going to the home page and using ""back"" goes through all the pages you have looked at rather than exiting. Of course it does make it too easy to spend my money ",5,1
love shopping with amazon...no hassle...everything you need under one roof and from the comfort of your own home....delivery service quick and efficient...highly recommend,5,1
"Good app, a quicker way to check on purchases, previous orders, shop for products and update account information. Also you can create lists for possible gifts and future purchases. Something for Amazon to consider would be to have some sort of security feature each time the app is used.",4,1
"App has issues. Saving to lists no longer works, it defaults to the same single list and doesn't allow you to select an option. frustrating...",1,-1
we are older sharing a car with adult son so being able to shop online helps allot. I can find products easily at different value and qualities levels.,5,1
"This app used to run flawlessly, I don't know what they did with the last update but the app is running like absolute trash now. Some parts of the app work, but then some of the most crucial Parts don't. For example I can check my gift card balance and other important information on my account, but I can't look at my orders at all in the app. Each time it just says ""Uh oh something went wrong on our end"" try again and its the same results. Yet, when I go to Amazon on Chrome it works fine //",1,-1
Amazon is amazing! Most things I can get very soon at a reasonable price. I have Prime. I'll continue to use it. Good business plan!,4,-1
"I love the convenience of shopping with Amazon. When i need something, i easily find it in here for decent price. Out of all online shopping places, Amazon is the one i use the most and shop more often from. Also another great thing is that with Amazon Prime, i can get free next day delivery, which is great as i do sometimes need things urgently. Having Prime membership means i also get access to Prime videos and songs library! Overall i am satisfied with Amazon. So far so good.",5,1
Overall love this app. But sending broken items. Forgetting items but not refunding us. I'm annoyed as hell I usually don't do reviews but I've lost alot of money due to you not sending packages/ or sending broken ones and making returns hard to do,3,1
i usually get my things on time and last time I was refunded after it took three days over and then still two weeks the person let me know it was delivered. i just would like a one priced subscription fee instead of steadily increasing. Other than that it's fine.,4,-1
The search features more and more favoring pay to play operators rather than the item you're actually looking for. I feel the quality of the app has been going downhill lately. I wouldn't have posted this but they asked what I was thinking so here's my honest review.,3,-1
Has been a problem for over  years now. Have tried using different phones but the app never starts up first time. Stuck on white screen and you refuse to fix it. Very annoying and makes me wanna use another app.,2,-1
neat shopping service but  stars because I was once a driver who delivered the prime packages working conditions are far less than ideal and they contradict themselves regarding safety.,3,-1
"I love Amazon Shopping, it's fast, easy and delivers are always on time. Ever package brightens my day!!! Thanks to all the hard working warehouse, delivery, truck drives, customer service, managers, IT technicians and all the logistics that are involved!!!!",5,1
"I love using the Amazon Shopping app. So easy to find what you want, even to comparison shop.",5,1
"Horrible. They may as well revive the search option since they show you countless things not related to the search, in the DISORDER they choose (vs. the same order you request EVERY time) and no way to exclude common items/features you find undesirable, no shirt l ability to enlarge images, and they continue to intentionally do nothing to allow buyers to shop by size -- very much like their piss-poor website, only worse.",1,-1
I love Amazon. Some items are a lot cheaper than the stores..with Prime membership you don't have to wait long.,5,1
I love the fact you can find just about anything you want and don't have to go to multiple stores. plus sometimes you can find out cheaper on here then my local store.,5,1
"Reliable, good choice of items, delivery is great. Used to send items to friends all over the country.",5,1
the best ever I have had no problems whatsoever. Excellent delivery every time I have made a purchase and no question about quality it's the best ! nice than,5,1
most items are not received when they are supposed to be here. I've been very sick and unable to get to the store. if I choose  day shipping I don't expect it  days later. just sayin,1,-1
Since covid there have been a lot of changes but I m seeing improvements. That one thing I wish they'd fix is the ability to customize when it is most convenient to get deliveries. If a package isn't delivered between am and pm on weekdays it is guaranteed to be thrown over my ft fence or my husband is going to find out I ordered more stuff,3,-1
"I love how I can rent movies get credits and boom get a  credit off books this is a great feature, well worth the prime membership thanks Amazon your amazing.",5,1
I use this app many times throughout the week; it always works without any problems. This is one of the VERY reliable apps available today.,5,1
"Service: -, app: around .. Looks like a s webpage, full of unnecessary information, poor animations and pretty ugly and sluggish. Mobile Website is way better, at  stars.",3,-1
"I've been a member of Amazon Prime for over  years, and I'm extremely happy with the service especially the  Day free shipping, I've always received my items on time and not damaged",5,1
"Annoying that you now can't purchase Kindle e-books through the app and have to do it in the browser. If I wanted to do everything in the browser, I wouldn't have installed the app in the first place!",2,-1
"For as big as Amazon is, the app is seriously lacking! App options are overly complicated, and its ridiculous that orders and returns arent in separate places. I hate having to scroll through orders to find returns. It would be nice to be able to see each return and whether you received the refund or not. Also, whatever intelligence used for search results is awful. If I search for ""blue long dress"" I get every color and length...Amazon can do better!",2,-1
"Well it was something wrong in past, like they deliver things in other place, but they straight fix it... So I love amazon, really can found things for me for perfect price...",5,1
They took my  dollars so I canceled the other  dollar order and removed prime they wanted to take my money and not get a refund even with prime my experience this week is not a very good one said refund in  days it's been one week and still no refund I'm actually pretty mad at the fact it's simple to refund something that never came. Problems like this shouldn't exist in  if they do you should close down the app.,1,-1
Love it use it a lot just be nice if there was a lower month fee. If u just want fast shipping no delivery fees. I don't use prime video music etc..,5,1
Love app! Shop on Amazon at least  times a month. Never have problems and when I do they replace item. Saves time.,5,1
"Great shopping app, affordable prices that comes with free shipping. What else could I ask for, I have always use Amazon and it never failed my expectations.",5,1
"Easy to find items. Easy to navigate options, too. selection is great!!",5,1
"This makes finding things you need easy and convenient. With Prime you get free shipping, and it arrives quickly. I've never had any issues with buying things on Amazon. If I needed to return the item, it was quick and easy.",5,1
"shopping easy with Amazon, love it. some of the products aren't what they say they are (not Amazon fault its the seller)",5,1
I really love that no matter what I am looking for Amazon always has it and for a great price! And the shipping is always quick and on time.,5,1
"Very easy to browse, to use and shopping. Everything you need? Can find it on Amazon and the app let's you find it easily.",5,1
"Amazon has been good to me from the jump. problem items are easily returned, items with availability through several vendors allow for readily comparable price shopping within the same store. They practically own their own mail system, no suggested improvements here!",5,1
"Amazon Shopping is fantastic. The items are as described, free and easy shipping, along with the best prices makes it my go-to place to buy!",5,1
"Usually a better service than other leading selling sites and faster delivery if you pay monthly for Amazon Prime, which in itself is beneficial if you make use of the Amazon TV that is also included in the same monthly payment, good sellers who are helpful and polite, who after seeing photographic proof of your problem/complaint will offer a refund or exchange without the unnecessary action of avoiding your emails and the prolonged matter of sorting your problem for you. Very happy customer ️",5,1
"I absolutely love amazon and amazon prime, they make life so much easier. couldn't live without amazon now. the app makes it so easy to buy all the things with just a few clicks and before you know it your products have arrived. very fast and have had no issues, not even any returns so far, and I've been using amazon for years. Couldn't lice without amazon and their plethora of products and lightning fast shipping. A Very pleased amazon prime member",5,1
"Poor, I found the app very difficult to navigate. Signing out is hard to find. As with many retail apps, via a browser is far easier.",1,-1
really easy to view Amazon good via the mobile. ordering is easy as long as one has ones Mobil all set up with mobile payments etc and the respective security.,5,1
"It's so very nice shopping with Amazon! It seems to always go smoothly whenever ordering. Thank you sincerely, Kevin Howarth in Narragansett, RI.",5,1
The process to change your new address if you end up moving is tedious and confusing. I ordered rosemary essential oil to make soap and it shipped to my old address. I don't want to be charged twice for the same product all because it was delivered to the wrong address. There's no way to change your address for something that's already been ordered.,1,-1
super responsive vendors if any issues. % less expensive with free shipping.,5,1
"The Amazon shopping app is super easy to use. Not only can I move back and forth, put things in my cart, & go back to where I was before, but I always seem to find exactly what.",5,1
"App keeps ""not responding"" as I'm trying to shop my baby registry. App freezes then closes before I'm able to get what's needed into my cart to even purchase anything. Super annoying",1,-1
"Update: the application constantly crashes showing those dog pictures. I have clear the cache on my phone, restarted, uninstalled and reinstalled the application, but keeps randomly crashing. It is frustrating!",3,-1
"Horrible, multiple times I have order through Amazon. I muggy receive / orders. The rest never show and I end up waiting months with cx saying wait another - days but tracking says it never left warehouse. Shipper never received it. I select Amazon packaging but the things I get never come in Amazon packaging. Same answer everytime I call in. Why is there no communication between departments...",1,-1
"Just like most people I know, this Amazon App is super convenient and easy to use. From tracking previous items to suggesting new one to purchase makes life stress free when shopping.",5,1
"I keep getting ""Something is wrong with the connection"" although I am connected, and just downloaded the Amazon app via my internet connection.",1,-1
"RIDICULOUS!!! This has gone from an easy way to shop to absolutley stupid that you cannot purchase through the app any longer !! All because of play store ! Seriously sort it out and stop making things harder for everyone else, if its not broke DONT fix it !!",1,-1
Love this app. I can pretty much find anything I'm looking for from clothes to food to clothes pins anything. if you get or have Amazon prime just about anything will be on your door step in  days with no shipping charges. how'd I ever live without this app or Amazon,5,1
"I don't understand the hype about Amazon. The clothes are always sized wrong and rarely matches the picture of what you're buying. Has a Wish feel to it. The Prime part is OK, but nothing to write home about.",3,-1
I can always find what I am looking for on Amazon. And Amazon gives you many choices and prices to fit your budget Thank You Amazon!,5,1
Fast and easy to order.  percent it's cheaper then in the store. More item to choose from you can't find in the store,5,1
I love shopping on Amazon. easy and don't have to leave the house. the quality as well as all types of items are exceptional.,5,1
"I Lurve Amazon! What an awesome market place! I found the prettiest lumbar pillow covers & pillows! And at an affordable price! I've started buying my over the counter medicines from Amazon. They have a huge varitety and a broad price range. Customer reviews are helpful in finding the best product for You. Sometime when you're bored with Facebook browse around, there are so many interesting things! Guess what? I found kitty cat tarot cards, lol! Lots of decks! lol",5,1
I am addicted to Amazon!!! nuff said!,5,1
"If I need something and can wait a day or  so I don't have to leave the house lol. Most of the pet food is cheaper than Walmart anyway and the Cameron's coffee is the same price I used to be able to get it from Walmart online, but it went up there so I buy it from Amazon now on subscription. love it",5,1
"It's great, I buy from here basically every week. However, I recently received a message that I am not allowed to review anymore. Which is fine, but I wish they would tell me why. I tried contacting support multiple times and have not received an answer and that is why I'm giving it  star. The customer service from Amazon themselves is terrible. I hope they will respond soon.",1,-1
"Since the last update it's no longer possible to make kindle ebook purchases directly onto my Android phone from the app. Really bad move, Amazon.",1,-1
"Almost always early or on time delivery, items are just as described. Almost like having a Walmart store that delivers free anytime,but things are much cheaper!",5,1
"No matter what I need, I can always find it on Amazon! I love the convience, selections and shipping. I recommend to all my friends and family. I am a long time customer and plan on being this for a long time to come.",5,1
"#, DARK MODE!!!! # this is a paid service and those ads/videos need to go! Terrible shipping. App needs an option to specify gender, (male/female as there are NO others!) Because the suggestions are just complete garbage and % of ZERO interest to me. Poorly managed app ran by a completely moronic company ",1,-1
"I love amazon. especially the app. easy to use, nice visualls, organized, easy purchasing and returning. it's one of the few place I truly trust to shop with. the first thing that comes to my mind when shopping is this app. you guys did ",5,1
"On my saved for later list, galaxy s snapdragon one ui ., it doesn't load articles after reach final article on that, but in another phone it works. You must add a button at the bottom of list to load more items or fix it.",1,-1
"a little more difficult to navigate since the last update... however, AMAZON clearly strives to provide the widest selection, and it's filters to provide what was the intended search has gotten better.",4,-1
They sold me a counterfeit and I'm still waiting on my refund which I cannot take as cash despite the fact that I've paid cash with an extra fee for cash on delivery. And of course they didn't allow me to comment on the worthless piece of j***. I thought Amazon was a respectable company. What a shame!,1,-1
It's been a month and I can't always load my orders. Not sure what is going on but I am not having issues with anything else on the app except Order page.,1,-1
simplicity at its finest. easy and user friendly an app can be. thanks for a great experience,5,1
easy and convenient with a wide selection of items but at times some products don't meet expectations. think that has to do with the suppliers though.,4,1
"love to shop at Amazon, it's at your convenience -. delivery is always on time. the items you buy are the same items you buy at a department or pharmacy store.",5,1
I always get great service and if I ever have a problem the customer service reps ALWAYS make things better and everyone of them are extremely knowledgeable and very respectful and kind. I would give them  stars if possible!,5,1
"These a-holes charged me $. for amazon prime, do yourself a favor and use a different shipping service. I don't even use amazon all that much I'd give them zero stars, but unfortunately the least amount this shop is permitting, is .",1,-1
"New update broke log in process. Not only did it log me out, I cannot log back in (the ""Continue"" button is broken). Always with the updates that break functionality, Amazon seems to always breaks what's fixed.",1,-1
"I'll have to say, that Amazon is the biggest and best company for a reason. if you've ever had to call their customer service it is world class excellent!! even their automated system is spot on I had to return an item and through the automated system I basically send a word salad but they understood it and connected me with the right persons!",5,1
"I am completely happy with the ease of locating and buying what I need. No more difficulty in finding something on foot or anywhere else online, just ""find it on Amazon."" You have raised the bar for everyone to compete higher.",5,1
Spanish Amazon prime ads in games I play with exit buttons to small to click accurately are changing the app to Spanish. This is an unacceptable level of security privilege. I'm not having an easy time getting there language back to English.,1,-1
No dark mode on Android . When in dark mode on S Ultra this app stays light why? Plus the search function is less than useless half the time cannot refine to search specific items.,1,-1
"I buy from Amazon any items I wish to receive quickly, not because of their price. But the search results is terrible, always, it does not match the exact search words and sometimes I just get fed up searching and buy from Ebay instead.",4,1
can find almost anything you need at discounted prices. ships fast and always arrives on time or earlier than expected.,5,1
"Delete the app, you'll just waste money.",3,-1
"Stellar UX/Ui for the app itself, and then you have the service and experience of Amazon's services which I think need no introduction. They are the category King of online shopping and always seem to be striving for perfection and innovation.",5,1
"Despise that you can no longer purchase through the app. As I do not have access to a desktop computer, you have made sure the bulk of my purchases will now be through Smashwords or similar app that purchase CAN be made with. Your decision has effectively told me to get lost. Yes-This app had good deals, can I access them?-No. Will I recommend it? - Not anymore.",1,-1
"Receives an empty bag today, no process to get a refund. I guess your supposed to chalk it up as a loss???? Such a hassel. Terrible experience. nd order they got wrong in a row. Prime is cancelled all pending orders are cancelled.",1,-1
"Great for finding things, and it's hard to beat the shipping costs with prime. But there's no way to see where the company is located, does not allow a way to report an abusive price/shipping costs for a product and it's impossible to get a live customer service agent in the line. Considering leaving Amazon after the multiplying bad practices.",2,-1
"App no longer gives indication which food products are EBT eligible or showing all items I saverd for later, to purchase at a later date....all that time wasted searching for items i wanted!!!! Start all over again ",2,-1
"Lack of polish. Feels like amateur app not trillion dollar company. Images don't work, cant zoom in, no way to send feedback, quite ugly design.",1,-1
"I'm disabled, so Amazon has been one of my many favorite blessings. I am grateful that I'm able to continue to be self reliant,at least with shopping amen ️",5,1
"The latest update doesn't allow you to buy ebooks ! I have to go to via the internet. So I might as well uninstal. Amazon help chat blamed it on Google, and said to contact the developer. The developer's email appears to be an Amazon email! I may as well uninstall the app. I feel like not bothering to buy anything from them again, books nor ebooks. I have a Kindle Oasis, may sell that too. There are other sources for books and ebooks, and other readers.",2,-1
"The Amazon Shopping app is easy to use, convenient, and simple. Good interface and I've never really had any problems using it. As far as shopping apps are concerned, there isn't much for me to criticize. Good job, Amazon app devs. /.",5,1
Stop asking me if I want Amazon Prime and Free shipping. I still get free shipping without Prime and I don't want your videos.,1,-1
Unfortunately this app hasn't been working very good lately it's sticking & freezing when scrolling and when adding items to your shopping basket.,3,-1
"Last time I called for an item missing in on my package I was hang-up on.. customer sure has gone down hill... I am looking for other shopping options...one option ""does this app have good customer service?""",2,-1
Somehow in the app smartly ask if you like to confirm card details and you realise that they acutally asking for renewing your membership and then ends up charging you. I already said NO to membership but still kept prompting me for it.,2,-1
"Search results are almost useless, even when searching a specific term, e.g.  battery there will be both sponsored products and regular results that do not match, and the search doesn't allow boolean modifiers to narrow results. The new UI, specifically for filtering, is just abhorrent; it fills the entire screen, the category tree is no longer clear, it kicks you out to search results every time you make a refinement, and you have less options for filtering.",1,-1
"the price are great  I just don't like when they say you're item will arrive a certain day, then it's running late then it'll arrive the next day from original delivery date.",4,-1
"love the Amazon App, easy to use, easy to contact the Amazon team eith any issues & great for quick buys!",5,1
Lost my business watch it now y'all the delivery times are not going to be on that date it at least take  weeks even if you're a prime member everything that I have ordered was late was never here and I noticed they are sending people fake tracking numbers I will be canceling my prime today!,1,-1
"The app works great but I prefer PC browser shopping just to see items better and navigate faster. For quick purchases, the app is simple and easy to use.",5,1
So many very sketchy and cheap quality items on here. lots of false advertising. it's annoying having to deeply read into the user reviews to discover it is not as advertised or is very poor quality.,3,-1
"Amazon tries to think for you and gets it wrong repeatedly. I search for Mookta (drysuit maker), and Amazon says ""Showing results for Mooka"" ""Search for Mookta instead"" (Mooka is a bunch of Air Filters) When I click Search for Mookta instead it puts Mooka in my search bar. Predictive text or software help can be useful. But the moment your software starts trying to tell people they are wrong when in fact the software is wrong... it's utterly useless.",3,-1
"App works well most of the time, offers good functionality. Sometimes doesn't work when I search for items.",4,-1
"Reporting sellers selling counterfeit goods is almost impossible with recent changes, and the notifications cannot be separated to remove the ads. The longer I use this app the worse it is becoming.",1,-1
The app works good. It's more than half of the cheap chinese garbage that Amazon sells that makes it nearly useless.,2,-1
i love Amazon But.....prime members never get their stuff on time but they're quick to get their funds. Amazon never follow their own wording on a product example a product will have if you spend $ same day shipping will be applied but it never works or happens. so you've spend $ extra and wasnt fulfilled by their promise,3,-1
"admittedly I get great deals through Amazon, I do love taking advantage of the variety of products that they have. the delivery service however is a little different I have in my instructions where to put my package and repeatedly they ignore the instructions I just ordered a package and they took a picture of it sitting on top of the porch instead of behind the door as I asked them and the package was not there and I didn't want to go  go thru the call reporting process.",1,-1
The app is fine and mostly works...few minor glitches that make it annoying on mobile devices... but I will be cancelling my Amazon account because of who processes their credit cards and how poor that customer service experience is.,1,-1
"This latest update put an alexa icon in the bottom of the page right in the way of things I want to look, you have to scroll to move something from behind the icon to see it, it is also put in a spot where it will be accidentaly touched. There are ZERO options, you can't turn it off, you cant move it, I will never use alexa EVER, it is SPYWARE. Give us the options",1,-1
"convenient, easy. I like that you can view comparable products. Generally pretty quick delivery.",5,1
I love shopping on Amazon. Usually find things that is unavailable to me locally and at a better price with free shipping. I been shopping on Amazon for almost  years and I'm very happy,5,1
"Lets not forget about the HIGH tax increase when placing an order. I've been ordering from Amazon for almost yrs now. I remember when there wasnt any taxes. For instance on a $ order, taxes will be $ or more.",2,-1
"Listing EBT eligible is sporadic. Recently they haven't marked them at all. Shopped from the listing it provided for ""EBT eligible only"" and at checkout only some of the total was. No indication of what wasn't. C'mon, Amazon, get with it! Make a listing of ONLY products that are eligible and leave out those that aren't. And fix your listings. GRRR!",3,-1
"I have been shopping on Amazon for well over a decade, having an Australian store is very handy and having Prime membership gives me the bonus of free expedited delivery.",5,1
"always easy to use, deliveries with prime are fantastic and the customer service is always quick to respond and assist with any issue regarding an order.",5,1
customer service is great when there are issues. Prime can save you a lot of money. Really happy with the Amazon app too...,5,1
"Edit / - this is now a ZERO STAR App. Can no longer buy or rent ANY digital content on Android. But they don't screw with ios! Purely abusive tactics to exclude the impoverished. Twice in a row now where updates have made the app more fustrating, less functional, and less accessible. No consideration for the visually impaired. I hate that I don't have a computer so I can ditch this app!",1,-1
Very convenient and easy,5,1
not what is used to be. paying for prime with a student discount but I think I'm saving and saving and gas that's for sure but honestly there's not that much that I get on here that I have been happier than I guess the losses have been good enough to where it kind of nullifies some at least some of the discount that I've forgotten so like the losses for example where $ earbuds which would have been wow what a great deal if they worked properly but they didn't,3,-1
"incredibly easy to order and navigate. Interactive screen, such a nice shopping experience.",5,1
"I hate every time I want to add an Item to the cart, the dam link to prime shows up and if pressed accidentally, I get charged. Remove those dam links for prime. I will choose if and when I want to get prime.",1,-1
"BUYER BEWARE! at least half of the things sold on Amazon have been faulty or otherwise falsely advertised, used to be fine, returns were easy. Now half the garbage they sell cannot be returned. Since I'm a student, i get a reduced rate, if i paid full price for this trash, I'd have unsubscribed months ago . -prev review- UH OH, OUR APP $#! ITSELF AND YOU CAN'T LOOK AT YOUR ORDER STATUS, SUCKS TO BE YOU. Unreliable p.o.s.",1,-1
I love ordering from Amazon. They have the best deals and items are fast delivery. I would recommend my family and friends to use Amazon.,4,1
"Terrible service... I paid an extra  dollars for the fastest delivery... Didn't deliver on the day it suppose to but yet the app says ""delivered at door or on porch"" called twice to see where my package was and the first lady told me it was still in transit, the other one told me it ""was"" delivered... Now I have to wait  more days for the package to arrive when I paid for the fastest delivery. I can't call back and I can't request a refund for that extra  dollars... Absolutely disgusting.",1,-1
"I love this app when I'm shopping, you will also if u like Jaw dropping eyeball popping good deals, as well as huge whopping meals. ice cream for dessert, they have all the yummy toppings, and for the mess afterwards pick up supplies for some heavy mopping, man sometimes I have a hard time stopping I love it like the Easter bunny loves hopping.",5,1
Nobody is perfect! But amazon comes pretty darn close. l have great great history with my shopping here.. No hassles whatsoever if there is ever a problem. Best place to shop..,5,1
Almost everything you are looking for. Sometimes you have to know exactly what you want before you can find it. Paying is easy and I love the Prime delivery.,4,1
I love Amazon Amazon has everything I get prime video just so I can have one day delivery for free which they always do I do a lot of shopping there once a month love it love it love it customer service is wonderful and a selection is marvelous thank you Amazon,5,1
"I love it, well. loved. until it started banning all my accounts when i tried to buy things. i'm not sure why cause it said it was on its way then temporarily banned me for ""suspicious activity"" then when i added my information to unban me, it says it's invalid and Im not sure what's with that? all i wanted was to buy a new phone/phone case and charger ",3,-1
Love it...... Definitely my got to place to shop to find the easy things and the not so easy things in a person's life.... Has it all..... Simple navigation,5,1
"There used to be items you can get with ebt, that being said those items would have a clear indication that you can purchase said item with ebt. That feature Is no longer there and customer service is a drag. This is an issue not just for me but a few others I know this might not be for everyone but it'd be great to know what you can or can not purchase with ebt.",2,-1
"I love shopping with Amazon. Only thing, if packages are stuck in customs, giving a separate notification for that is Very helpful! Still waiting on a custom diamond painting... was supposed to arrive mid-March. I feel it's wrong to request a refund when I could still receive the package. IDK if you, Amazon, have a protection policy in regards to ensuring the vendor still receive their dues. Or give the option for the vendor to resend a ""lost/stuck"" package.",5,1
"Stole my gift card money, I paid and the transaction went through and then a week later amazon canceled my order and kept the money had to buy more gift cards to top it up. And then finally got my package over a month late and slightly damaged. But was too afraid of Amazon stealing from me again to try and return it.",1,-1
"easy to use, nice UI. keeps changing frequently with every other app update though.",4,1
I cannot purchase Digital music from the app no more. On Both of my phone's. An absolute total disgrace and you have made things  times more difficult. Thanks a bunch Amazon. You are pathetic. And another thing: Do Not Treat your distribution centre workers like Poo. I know corrupt firms like you. A complete joke.,1,-1
Amazon is the most useless app I have ever seen..I ordered something for two weeks now and they closed my account saying they will get back to me and they are still reviewing...after I get my refund then I will delete the app,1,-1
very easy way to shop and get items quickly. it can be a little expensive depending on the item.,4,1
Where did all the notifications for what was and wasn't EBT eligible go on the app? Am I supposed to guess? Or wait until it's in my cart and check... Honestly please fix this.,1,-1
"This is ridiculous. I am constantly getting kicked out of screens while shopping, searching, browsing, etc. It jumps back to the home screen or random screens while I'm trying to search through items and shop! I don't know what's going on, but it's beyond frustrating and annoying! I've called Amazon to troubleshoot re installed, cleared everything, checked settings. Still an issue! UPD // STILL AN ISSUE NOTHING RESOLVED!",1,-1
"Ads are way too loud! While playing the game Hill Climb Racing , when an Amazon shopping ad comes on it's Extremely Loud. So loud that it will startle people around me! You are part of a large problem with all companies make their ads Extremely Loud. You want the proper attention that you're looking for then stop making the ads so loud where they become annoying",1,-1
"Amazon has everything I need, and with me being a prime member, I get my items faster and it is always delivered on time! thanks Amazon!",5,1
"LET ME BUY MY BOOKS! Seriously, you now have to open your browser if you would like to buy a Kindle book! You can no longer buy from the app. That is the stupidest thing ever. What is the point of having the app if I have to open in the browser? Might as well just keep it locked in my browser. . .",2,-1
"I use without prime because I don't shop on a regular basis nor do I have home broadband. But amazon is second to none in terms of service and delivery, thanks Amazon.",5,1
Buggy app. Bloated. Slow. Alexa keeps popping up in the app at random. No way to turn it off.,3,-1
I absolutely love this company they are so awesome. Never thought I'd like shopping online because in the old days the return factor was so time consuming. But I love their return policy.,5,1
"Absolutely LOVE shopping with Amazon, they have everything I look for with better deals and/or better quality. Returning products is very simple and no frustratingly long delays for money back. Shipping speeds are very fast for me especially with Prime and ive never recieved a damaged product delivered to me. I've never had a problem with Amazon so it's my # go to for when it comes to shopping online. To the many years of great service!",5,1
"Thanks, Amazon, for saving me money by making it harder to buy digital items. You can't buy them on the app anymore, so I will bother far less. Sparing me the expense of 'on a whim' shopping.",3,1
"Amazon is cool... I just wish they would STOP repeatedly double charging (low key stealing) my $. Stop double charging me for Amazon Prime, please & thanks #Amazon. ",4,-1
Stop it Amazon!! I keep getting Prime added. so annoying as I have to go into delivery details nearly every time to remove.,2,-1
Amazon is the best way to shop without spending unnecessary time on different sites. Prime makes life easier because you get the bonus of paying a yearly subscription and all deliveries will exclude charges.,5,1
"I've been an Amazon customer for many years. Recently though, I have noticed a lot of products that are coming out of China that are extremely cheap and definitely not worth the money that they charge. More and more are charging shipping, some are price gouging and should not even be allowed to sell on Amazon, it is not being monitored. My review would have been a five-star if not for this happening. Get on the ball Amazon! You sure pull in enough money to be able to have people monitoring this!",4,-1
"Easy to use. customer service is amazing. if ive ever had an issue, they solve it fairly and immediately.",5,1
"Super easy to navigate, ABSOLUTELY love Prime & Amazon Fresh. DEFINITELY worth the monthly fee we paid. Plus, Customer Service is SUPER quick calling you when a you request a call back & available /...REALLY can't beat it!!",5,1
"I love, love, love Amazon Prime! You can't beat Amazon - they have just about anything you want at reasonable prices, guarantee their products and deliver them to your home fast! What more could you want? I highly recommend Amazon to everyone. We use them regularly. They're awesome and well worth the price!",5,1
"I am giving amazon shopping a / star review due to them losing two of my orders within the past year. however in return they were quick to offer and give a refund. other than this dilemma Amazon Shopping is pretty quick even when delivering to the island of Oahu, Hawaii. ",4,-1
easy shopping. decent prices. latly the customer service has deteriorated. I've been a prime member for + years and am considering canceling and going with Walmart+.,4,1
I do all my shopping on Amazon Prime. Everything I buy now is bought on Amazon. No store carries such a wide choice of items. Free shipping and fast delivery service is well worth the cost of Prime. No more wasting gas going from store to store not when Amazon has it all. Their No Question Asked return policy can't be matched. Customers Service is extremely helpful with all questions and problems.They help with me out by talking to the seller and getting me the needed info for a replacement.,5,1
Website>App. Simple as that. At least the website works. App sits on splash for  minutes before crashing. It's very disappointing as I was looking for something a bit more mobile friendly.,1,-1
"For some reason Amazon have removed the means to buy kindle books via the app. As I bought all my books from this , annoyed is not the word. For me , having this app now is pointless.",1,-1
They do their own shipping now and it always goes to the wrong address. I contacted them and they still didn't solve the problem. I want USP back at least I got my items then. So now I stop my Prime Time membership because of their shipping problems.,1,-1
I love shopping on Amazon. It is easy to order items. I have free shipping. If I need to make a return I can just run it to Kohls. They have great quality merchandise.,5,1
Great way to beat the Hussle and bustle of going in town to shop. no need to find car park or wait in long lines of people at checkouts. shopping at a click of a button,5,1
love amazon shopping it's so convenient and my orders arrive quickly. if there is an issue they are quick to respond.,5,1
"Can no longer purchase digital goods from the app including books, music, and TV shows. I realize that Amazon's stock answer is to side load Amazon's sorry excuse for an App Store and disable updates but I don't side load entire stores, especially inferior stores. I sincerely hope that Amazon reconsiders their short sighted cash grab and restores this important functionality.",2,-1
Searching for something on Amazon will result in qdvertisements about those products everywhereon the web. Unfortunately Amazon is completely intransparent how user data is veing used. In the application it's impossible to make real provacy settings. I strongly believe Amazon is deliberately comitting GDPR violations. I think it's time for a GDPR complaint!,1,-1
"Consistent late deliveries, ""undeliverable"" packages, no notification of status changes. All for a monthly premium. ",1,-1
I love shopping at Amazon. There are lots of choice and is easy and convenient. Delivery is no hassle.,5,1
"App works well most of the time. Occasionally crashes with the ""Uh oh something went wrong"" message. Notifications are sometimes not even closely related to what I have been shopping for with no clear way to remedy that issue...",3,1
"I love Amazon shopping , I must be one of their most loyal customers!!!! They have always been excellent at fixing problems or refunds etc ..../",5,1
"Amazon prices are competitive and fair, sometimes even better deals! I appreciate having Amazon for shopping needs",5,1
"I love Amazon shopping it's easy, great deals, lots of stores, and free shipping if your a prime member.",5,1
I did not approve Amazon to take  dollars out of my account for prime membership. it did not even ask me I clicked on a button to checkout and it automatically took it. not happy with this,1,-1
"Very slow to respond on the latest hardware . Too many clicks to get to primary interfaces. Buried the customer support access. Slow to add items to cart, inconsistent behavior when calculating shipping times",2,-1
"It's a great place to buy anything you're looking for. I've never had any problem with my orders. They always stay true to their delivery commitment and they're always on time. If you can't find it in Amazon, it doesn't exist.",5,1
I like the app except for when I check on my orders. I get a loading screen whether I'm connected to my wifi or not. Everything else works but seeing my orders is very important.,3,-1
"can be awesome, but also beware when your only priority is cheap prices. you get what you pay for.",4,1
"I rarely go into stores. Online shopping is just easier. Amazon has everything I need. This app keeps track of browsing, lists, subscriptions,orders and delivery schedule. I can locate receipts quickly. I can make return requests quickly.",5,1
"I've been a Prime member for  years. I mainly did this for shipments. I didn't start taking full advantage of all the benefits of Prime until  years ago, Prime Video, Music, Games,etc. I truly wouldn't know how to act if I didn't have Prime with all of its other services!",5,1
"The app is really nice, but for some stupid reason Kindle books can no longer be purchased through the app. This seems like the stupidest of stupid decisions. Hey Amazon, I installed your app because I want to purchase things from you. LET ME F DO IT! How ridiculously dumb! Incredibly frustrated right now.",4,-1
"I read voraciously. I buy Amazon ebooks all the time. In addition, I am am author who is only published on Amazon. Now, Amazon decided to do an update that forbids users from buying ebooks from the app, not only screwing me on future royalties but also preventing me and countless others from purchasing ebooks from the Amazon app. Do better, Amazon.",1,-1
Not a well polished experience from a multi billion dollar company. Get results totally unrelated to the search. Usually overpriced and eBay is a much better user experience,1,-1
DO I REALLY NEED TO DO A REVIEW... ITS AMAZON!!! GOT TO LOVE IT!!,5,1
"Easy to use, easy to shop, easy to navigate around all your Amazon services. Also works great for tracking your deliveries. Not so user friendly for some refunds. A laptop is required for that on occasions.",4,1
"I noticed others experiencing difficulties with the orders page loading as I was as well. I uninstalled the app, then installed it again and it is working. Otherwise I find the basic ordering features very user friendly, but once you need to contact Amazon or cancel something it is somewhat trickier to locate the first time around.",4,1
One of their products broke  of my personal products that was around $ it has been over a month and I am still talking with claims about getting this replaced. I have been a customer for  years plus you would think that they would help me with this faster and more efficiently.,1,-1
"In L. Frank Baum's kids book; 'The Magical Monarch of Mo', the townspeople pick from the trees whatever they wish to own.. whether it be a ring or a garden cart... so too, with Amazon...like one big tree for picking! Too easy to use, but oh so satisfying! I never have to keep a list! Just wish, tap, and your wish appears! !",5,1
Would have got  stars but can no longer make digital purchases through the app. Which is rather frustrating to have to go through to the website to make the purchase and somewhat defeats the purpose of the app. Why the sudden change?,3,-1
"The whole point of signing up for prime is to get your packages delivered early, unfortunately this is not the case anymore. Amazon used to be a really good place to shop and get your things shipped the next day, however lately, everything is ""delayed"" but somehow the draft for prime payment is never delayed. There's a lot of small businesses making a comeback I'd suggest one of those platforms since Amazon is no longer delivering what they promise, and I'm pretty sure it's false advertising.",2,-1
"Amazon can be a major lifesaver at times. There are a few times you might not be happy. Be careful of how you word your review of products, total honesty is not exactly what they want. I do not usually give  reviews because nothing is perfect, there will always be a few flaws which makes it all normal or balanced. Keep track of your orders they do have a pretty good customer service team, resolved or refunded. Amazon will get behind it & resolve it.",4,1
"I can find pretty much everything I look for here. Fast shipping, good quality. And so many unique items! I love shopping on Amazon",5,1
"Highly disappointing that I can no longer purchase ebooks through the app. Apparently it has something to do with Googles new policy; however, if I have to use my internet browser to purchase ebooks (which I do on a daily basis) then there is no point in having the app at all as I will just use the internet browser on my phone. I'd much Ratner the app, but oh well.",1,-1
"Amazon changed the layout of the app, now I cannot find where I can log out, change country or any other setting. The app is trying my patience every time I want to use it. It's interface sucks and difficult to navigate. Is Amazon try to experiment on torturing customers? Because using the app feels like torture.",1,-1
Bad all bad,1,-1
This app has Manny Minor problems but the biggest one is how the payment after uv already ordered all ur things keeps going to revision even when it's a stable payment method. This isn't a one time problem ether it's a everyday problem we're I keep getting bothered and I'd like it to stop if not I'll be taking my business elsewhere,4,1
Purchased new phone Samsung + and app is not recognising my log on. Yet I have Nil problems in logging on to account on PC. Loved using app on phone sooo would love to see this fixed please,1,-1
"TECH DEPT - PLEASE FIX PAST ORDER ACCESS ASAP!! No access to past orders... for the last few weeks I can no longer see my past orders. App opens fine and it seems like all other sections are working just fine, except this important info.",1,-1
PLEASE fix the order button bug. When I click on orders to track it times out and gives a dog picture. This is incredibly frustrating!!,1,-1
The best service in the region. Excellent shopping experience with a lot of options. I'm a prime subscriber ever since they introduced the fast delivery feature among other good benifits that came with it. Thank you for providing us with such an excellent compititve service.,5,1
The good thing is that they accept EBT and have an alright selection also. It's good for everyday items but eBay has better deals on electronics.,4,1
"For weeks, despite unistall & reinstall i have not been able to access my prior orders. It is a feature i used the most. Please fix this bug.",1,-1
most stuff I order. I am happy customer and had a few things that weren't worth it but most prices are better then getting it anywhere else.,4,1
"What I like about Amazon is that I don't have to go out for shopping sorting things I can or on my break time, with this busy life is convenient.",5,1
"Great products at great prices, along with great service/delivery. They make online ordering so great so you don't have to leave home.",5,1
"Needs improving. App style and layout isn't as good as it used to be. My main annoyance is not being able to archive orders on the phone app! Like many I share an account with my partner and come birthdays it's really frustrating not being able to archive and saying ""don't use amazon, turn your notifications off for weeks"". Please fix this!",3,-1
there are  things that are bad the first is you don't receive orders as quickly and the second thing is if they don't ship it through Amazon I never get it when they say I will,4,1
mostly convenient for select items the slow increases in price are making it more and more worth while making the trip even out of town to find a store that carries the same items you need but overall customer service is always good and shipping is very quick which is nice,4,-1
The best place for a wedding registry. It keeps track of who bought the gifts and you can even send a thank you from your account. Another reason to love Amazon.,5,1
The best shopping experience! I love the convenience of shopping at any hour. Amazon always has what I need.,5,1
"Why will more than % of the time my order history not load and result in an error??? It's ridiculous and annoying that I can't even get to my placed/completed orders. Clearing the cache and or closing/restarting app doesn't resolve this problem either. Check the ORDERS screen guys. Seems like it's waiting for a response that it's not getting. Yet the ""Buy again"" items on that screen keep getting shuffled.. but no orders will show ",3,-1
Easy browsing and easy to pace orders. Has the same features as using a computer.,5,1
This is great just sometimes I would get it was ship to me it end up at another house. I have nothing really bad to stay cause at the end they are doing a good job. Where I live yes people will come by and steal you purchased items if you put where you want your package they would put it they no question.,5,1
"Dropped to  stars: when I choose to shop for a friend outside of the U.S, I choose their address for delivery, but too many items show up that say it is out of the delivery range. Very disappointing. When doing internationally, only companies that will ship to the selected address should show up in the search results. Creates a lot of wasted time. Is a major inconvenience for an app that is supposed to make things convenient.",3,-1
"Majority of the services I use are no longer available via the app. As of today (//) in app purchases for Kindle ebooks and Audible audiobooks are no longer available. I will have to exit the app, open the browser, go to website, log-in, search the item(s) and then make a purchase. Amazon stated this was done to comply with Google's updated Play Store policies. This just made ebook/audiobook shopping difficult. I'll stick to KU. If it fail. I'll use the public library for easier access.",3,-1
"I really like this app. sometimes when I am on my Android phone the Google speech to text does not work in the search bar. other than that, I love it",4,1
still one of the best ways to shop. I gave  stars cause they sometimes hold orders. if you pick free ship so it arrives on date but I've had it deliver late because of this.,4,1
Amazon have removed the option to buy Kindle books from the Amazon app on a Samsung phone. You now have to log into your account on the website. Why have they decided to make things more inconvenient? Not happy!,1,-1
"have been using for years and have yet to be disappointed. whether it's the ordering, delivery, quality or customer service, it's all been great",5,1
Amazon is fitting worse and worse. Package are no longer being delivers when they say they r which defeats the purpose of the membership. There are now two backcto back packages that r supposedly running late and now no delivery date but says the package is I'm my area. This is ridiculous. Should I get rid of the membership cause it does seem to make a difference.,1,-1
"Its for shopaholics that like blowing money. another QVC kinda. it does have its perks, but Id rather just go shopping for my own stuff. At the same price. Actually, Ive found it better to just get your butt up because Ive saved more that way.",2,-1
hate all the suggested and sponsored stuff that I don't want and didn't search for pop up. search engine sucks and produces thousands of results that had nothing to do with my search criteria.,3,-1
very reliable service with good customer service. just occasionally the driver is bit lazy when delivering and doesn't bother knocking. But there is a feedback service so you can notify Amazon when this happens,4,1
Cannot by kindle books using the app anymore. So what's the point in having the app if I lost the ability to purchase things using it? Between this and audible forcing me to go to the web page I'm not a happy Amazon customer. Convenience is gone so guess I will not be purchasing much anymore,1,-1
"few years ago Amazon used to be the best option for online buying it was nothing better than Amazon until about  years ago I started having problems with shipping even though with the prime membership, then customer service turn to customer fighting now so as an eBay shopper as well I prefer eBay they have the same policy and you don't feel mistreated, I used to spend up to $, per year in Amazon vs $, eBay, now $, eBay and $, Amazon. try eBay first",3,-1
"This is a good app. It's not as powerful as the web site, but it's got everything you need while on the go. I wish the notifications were more configurable.",5,1
Suddenly useless to ebook readers. Tried to purchase a book on the app tonight and it tells me that I can not purchase ebooks through the app so they can stay compliant with Google Play. Great job! Just screw all of us readers over after convincing us we needed the app.,2,-1
"Very convenient way to shop, no hassles, wider choices, balanced reviews to guide you make the best choice.",5,1
"super hard to compare products, filters/facets work awfully, sorting doesn't work correctly, especially by price, search is pretty good, related products could be better, search in reviews is not convenient, between product description and reviews there's a lot of garbage that tries to move me away from the product",3,-1
I have plantar fasciitis and bought the expensive inserts from my podiatrist office....these work just as well and actually support my arches better. I no longer have foot pain and I'm back on the tennis courts. I'm buying  more pair so that I don't have to swap them out with in different tennis shoes. I even slide these in my Crocs to walk around the house on our hard floors. I can't be without these inserts.,5,1
"people, be aware, they are becoming a scame business. After many years of purchases in thousands of dollars via amazon they refused to refund me $ for an item, for which i Paid and Never received. very dissapointing move towards their loyal customer.",1,-1
This company was good when I first joined but now for some reason they decided to rip off people by charging $ . a month for free shipping and handling some of us can't afford that policy they refund in gift card's then they charge ridiculous fees to buy from everything is already expensive why make it worse,1,-1
"The bigger Amazon gets, the more streamlined they try to become the worse the service and horrible delivery practices! Especially when I'm giving a specific instruction on what my house looks like and how it's full of BIG RIGS on the property! How the hell do you miss a BLUE house with Semi Trucks on a  acre property!! And now they have my address correct but all my packages are late or ""may be lost""",1,-1
Amazon is my go-to for most all of the Online shopping that I do. And they stand behind what they sell. I've always been able to get an issue easily resolved.  stars,5,1
"Can't wait til anything remotely close to a competitor comes along. Tired of paying increasingly higher fees for mediocre customer service when things go wrong, which they seem to do more a lot more than they used to. When something does go wrong w an order, most of the time it requires the help of a live agent on the phone bc either the bot doesn't understand or the agent via chat doesn't get it, either. I love some features, but the hassles are getting to be more than the $/yr is worth.",3,-1
"Useless! Thanks to Google Play's ""new restrictions"", you can no longer make purchases through this app, making it virtually useless. Don't bother. I'll be uninstalling and just pinning the website to my home screen.",1,-1
"Easy to use, easy to purchase things you think you need but don't, easy to remove stuff, easy to put things on monthly renewals. All in all, it's a pretty wicked app.",5,1
"""We're sorry your package is late. Please contact amazon for the next steps"" Except they provide no way to contact them about my order. It also doesn't explain why I'm supposed to contact them or if I should just wait? App constantly glitches, freezes, crashes, and they also have censored and refused my item reviews for stating that South Korea is a more ethical country to purchase from than China and produces higher quality goods.",1,-1
"I have not been able to get into my account for about three years due to being hacked twice. the reason I was hacked a second time was because I could not access my account to change my password so they nearly bought something. My account has been shut down ever since I have tried to contact you and called before but no one is helping me and I can't make a new account due to my old account using same details like phone number, address and name. I cannot even leave reviews or contact you by email",1,-1
"Back in th day, whn I was a youn'gn & th Mall was th experience, bottom line; shopping  feeling better Is fortunately or unfortunately th All-American experience. Amazon shopping makes it a quicker uptake  be USA, feel good easy accessibility of good endorphins fo us working stiffs. Who often & lately need that upshot of feel-good n these diminished days for good news, or good anything abound. That Amazon pkg in th mail always fulfills, over the d a rk.",5,1
I love Amazon. It's my go too spot to get everything for my crafting business to everything for my home. The only thing I dislike is I have a prime account and it still takes maybe a week sometimes for me to get an order that I have placed and then sometimes they come before the delivery date.,5,1
"Extremely disappointed in Amazon!! Customer service continually lies to you!! I've been having problems with delivery notifications - we have a problem with Porch Pirates, and I just asked that they text me when a package is delivered, so I can either go grab it myself or have my neighbor get it. First they said said it would be fixed, but nothing happened. Now today, I'm told that this option no longer exists!! Seriously?? WHY NOT??? I'm DONE WITH AMAZON - BYE!! ",2,-1
Seamless shopping experience. Always easy to use and very straight forward. Never had a problem yet.,5,1
I shop amazon daily. Prime member benefits are very good if you just read a bit. The daily and lightning deals can save you a good amount of money then add % cash back if you have the amazon card makes deals even better. I recommend getting the amazon card to save that % which adds up fast also has good offers to save on other purchases outside of amazon.,5,1
"I used to love using amazon, because it was so easy. But they have recently made it really difficult to report items and sellers that are baiting and switching their customers. It's also very difficult to report items that are knock-offs or outright racist. The app makes you jump through hoops to contact customer service and actually speak to somebody. The options it does give you, are very generic and leave out your ability as a customer, to explain your situation.",3,-1
"Addicted to Amazon, fast cheap.. what's not to love. so far every order I've place in the past  years has gone smoothly and the one that had a issue was resolved quickly. Def trust my purchases being protected",5,1
"Better than Walmart. Walmart tells me delayed more often than not. Bigger selection on Amazon and Walmart isn't always cheaper. I used to be a huge Walmart fan. Anymore, I might check Walmart prices but ultimately end up back on Amazon. most of the time now I just go straight to Amazon. Better, faster and wider range of products, Amazon beats Walmart, hands down.",5,1
I can't say enough how great Amazon is. I buy a lot though Amazon and they are great to deal with.,5,1
Don't know if anyone else is having this problem but the app won't allow me to access my orders or order history. Its frustrating because I'm not always by my home computer when I need to check delivery times. Hopefully this gets fixed soon.,4,1
"I love Amazon shopping, a little too much if I'm totally honest! It's just so easy, the range of items is amazing and the delivery guys are always friendly and professional. The best thing for me? I'm disabled and I don't need to leave the house, I can usually find exactly what I want......sometimes before I know I wanted it! Keep up the good work amazon ",5,1
Love app use all the time... I wish that we could choose made in USA instead of getting China stuff shipped... and wish it took payment right away instead of waiting.. it throws my account off,2,1
"Amazon is the best, helpful and delivery everything what I need to my door. Fastest delivery of any other online shopping or store.",5,1
Usually a great app but for the past  weeks I haven't been able to view my orders. The page just never loads and I have to go to a web browser to view orders. Please fix.,2,-1
All my orders have bean complete as ordered and arrived usually ahead of time from original estimate. All my additional delivery instructions have bean executed flawlessly. big thumbs up.,5,1
Absolutely LOVE my Amazon and they are always so nice and easy to work with. You can tell they really appreciate and care for their customers.,5,1
For the most part products and shipping times are as advertised but a small number of vendors misrepresent their product availability or shipping times. All in all pretty good services from Amazon shopping.,4,1
"I haven't used many shopping sites to buy things from, but compared to a couple of ones I have used I feel more comfortable with Amazon. Great customer service and excellent delivery . I haven't had any reason to believe that Amazon deliver .",4,1
Hard to chat with associate. The text box should move above the keyboard because you are unable to see what you are typing Update: cart does not load past the first  items or so in it Still no fix to the cart  months later,1,-1
I think Amazon have really good to us a Especially over the past couple of years with everything that has been going on they have always been on time and followed my instructions wear to leave my parcels thankyou so very much for all your hard work much appreciated,5,1
great fast and quick. the compare chart doesnt work to well it wont display all the info,5,1
"Amazon is my go to for just about everything! Since the pandemic, I was forced to do a lot of online shopping and Amazon is the way to go. Their return policy is great as well!",5,1
It's very easy to shop on amazon but delivery is another thing. Most of the time the delivery drivers don't follow instructions for the safe place or they just lie about where they have left it or thrown it.,1,-1
"Amazon has everything one could ever hope to ask for or need! There is always someone somewhere wanting to sell whatever it is you are looking for, evenif its discontinued from days gone by. You can always find the best price just keep searching, there are always other suggestions, plenty of reviews, & star rates. Always get what you need from A-Z!",5,1
I was charged  times from Amazon. I called what I thought was customer support got the number from Google. And was talking to customer support. And they hacked my phone and stole money from my bank. I still ended up paying . for something that should have only been  dollars. And more because the hacker stole . dollars from my bank account. Well learned my lesson will not be ordering from Amazon again. Because even after I finally got a hold of Amazon customer support they did nothing.,1,-1
best way to shop,5,1
Terrible service! The shipping company are cancelling the orders without customer request! I placed my order twice and the delivery guy doesn't want to deliver it in the evening but his working hours from am to pm. So disrespectful! The customer service does nothing and offers me to place my order again!,1,-1
this why I hate online shopping cause returning stuff is a hassle I bought  pants that's are a size smaller I have to go through return process just to re order the same thing in a different size .. and exchange size not an option SMH,2,-1
"Amazon is an amazing worldwide app for this i give it s but i wish it had a wider catergory for boy toys not just cars and dinosaurs because not all buys like them and maybe redyce prices (not to be petty) But i never buy clothes,bags or stationary from hear shein have much lower prices :) So i would rather a price drop but when you have a huge pricedrop on the amazon tablets it was amazing but ebay and arfos did the same and we could pick it up from argos so we bought it from them ;)",5,1
I guess it was good but this is my first order let's see how that goes remember I'm looking for a back rim with the hub motor -in rim one sprocket disc brakes let's see how that goes skinny tires street tires really,4,1
"Used to like the app. She I can't buy digital content/ books here anymore ""to comply with Google play guidelines). As I use Amazon for Kindle content mainlyakes it pointless for me. Also, the interface changed a while back, it's more of a pain to navigate than it used to be I find personally.",3,-1
"It's good for ordering in web, but I can't open it on google play. After I choose my currency, the Amazon app close and when I tried to reopen it, i can't, so I uninstall it and re install it again",2,-1
"The app is fine i suppose but the Amazon site is now just full of rip off artists, cheap Chinese junk and scalpers. Hard to find a good bargin on here anymore.",1,-1
Amazon is doing an amazing job right now definitely  stars. especially because of the Amazon fresh part of the app for groceries. makes life super simple when it comes to stocking the kitchen and that's something I very much appreciate.,5,1
"The best shopping app I have ever used. definitely deserves a  star review. They work with you on mutiple things such as if you have a problem with wrong orders, late orders, broken items, wrong size etc you name it they will help you. I rarely give  stars but they deserve it! I will continue to buy from them in the future.",5,1
"Hands down the best place to buy anything online. Always speedy with the deliveries and never any problems with the payment transactions. Amazon is, simply put, AMAZING!!!",5,1
"Completely obsessed with Amazon and take full advantage of it's benefits!! just wish you could narrow your searches better, but above all definitely the best prices for most items!!",5,1
I can no longer buy books on my phone??? If I try to go to the website it keeps opening the app and the app won't let me buy books. Unbelievable!,2,-1
"Almost never had the need to shop anywhere else online, this app really has (mostly) anything you could be looking for at pretty great prices. Easy to use and quick shipping really make it a must for online shopping.",5,1
they do good deals and do have on line coupons for some items just wish the delivery guys would hide the items on the porchs a little better do to I live in a high crime area but other than that no complaints,4,-1
I have had an Amazon Prime membership on and off for years. The last time I was billed I had no idea because I swore I had paused the subscription. I checked the app without success then checked Google on how to request a refund as I've never used the subscription. It has been a whole month now since I was told that within - business the refund will be reflected in my account. Each time I chatted in to query they 'escalated' the case and still nothing! Extremely disappointed in your lies!,1,-1
"Robbery, this is the second time that I have not received what I paid for! Do they care? No, of course not!!! Here's a suggestion, STOP sending things through USPS as they tend to ""lose"" packages. I hope the postal worker's kid that got my daughter's dress is as happy with it as my little one would have been! ",1,-1
"Suddenly, the app says Kindle purchases aren't allowed on this app. Apparently this is a thing that's affected iOS users for a while, but now it's caught up to Android and I suddenly can't buy through the app. I'm not going to do the extra few steps of adding to a list, then leaving the shop to go to the website in order to make the purchase. What the heck sense does that make? Why do I even need to app if I have to go to the website to make a purchase?",3,-1
A great easy to use app from Amazon with lots of features for online shopping. An app I like and use a lot!,5,1
"I Love Amazon !!. I'm not one for shopping in stores. it gets so overwhelming for me. people, noises, lighting. in my area we don't have a huge selection for my taste in home decor or just daily things. so Amazon makes it beyond easier for me, to get what I want and need.",5,1
Amazon dropped the ball as usual they failed to notify users of a credit card. Allowing unauthorized users to not only make purchases off our credit card but allowed them to make the purchase. And possibly receive their goods all undetected!! Now we're battling for information,1,-1
"Gave an abandoned building for hub address that they never delivered to, and kept returning back to facility where I was not allowed to pick it up. Didn't care at all to get my order to me just wanted to give a refund and tell me to go away. Absolutely HORRIBLE customer service.",1,-1
"I love the app, but recently the page that shows my orders isn't loading. There's a bar along the top that appears to indicate that it's loading, but then the screen just flashes every  or so seconds, over and over and over. Nothing ever loads. ‍️ Other than that, it's great!",4,1
"Constantly late deliveries, not just a by hours but days and weeks. Items not being correct,used items being sent. Amazon is getting slower specifically by deliveries and consistency. It's getting old quick",1,-1
"I haven't seen any ads that's the best thing Takes me directly to the site no lag. Within a second or two Glad to have it. Thank you, John S.",5,1
"I love shopping on Amazon. They make it so easy to find and get the things I need. I hate shopping on Amazon, they make it so easy to find and get the things I want, thus making it too easy to spend my money.. LOL. The app is fantastic because of it's ease of use.",5,1
I'm a man of convenience and ease. This app is both and comes with points discounting throught their CC. Awesome!!!,5,1
"I've been having delays in deliveries, products with expectations of arrival on the day and not even sent, I'm disappointed with the ""prime"" service that was already good.",1,-1
"Can no longer browse or purchase mp albums. Can't listen to samples, can't see reviews. And, when you click on one it takes you to the music app. So dumb, so annoying.",3,-1
"App is ridiculously slow lately. Won't load orders, packages showing up late or not at all.",1,-1
"I do % of my shopping here & have for several years now. You will not find a better place to shop where you can buy EVERYTHING you need or want. In addition to this, Amazon's Customer Service is # in my world. They are so helpful, & the friendliest people I've ever talked to. Saves me from having to drive anywhere to shop, $ in gas, not go out in inclement weather, etc... Free  day or sooner shipping, & easy returns. Amazon Shopping is ""THE BEST! "" NOW, GO SHOPPING!!!!!",5,1
"Love this app. It remembers what you browsed and shows you similar items. It's fast and easy to browse, buy and pay.",5,1
"Keeps everything I have ordered and looked at, in the convenience of an app. I like it better than the website.",4,1
I love Amazon shopping! they make things so convenient! from free shipping the next day to easy to find items and clear pricing!,5,1
perfect. managed to just swap out the button part and it works perfectly.,5,1
not a big fan of the auto-subscription options. it would be nice if I could opt-in on subscriptions instead of having to hunt for the option to opt-out,2,-1
Great App! I find it quite quite easy to use. Browsing and Shopping is fast and easy.,5,1
It's Amazon what's there to say? I can look for compare prices and buy an ship right  my door. The only thing I hate is that they stopped  day guaranteed delivery on prime items with my prime membership it used to be everything prime is  days no matter what now it can be  days  days.. When you get something marked prime I used to expect it in  days but now it could come at the end of the week when I order Mon. I don't like how they did that without any warning just happened nothing said,5,1
it's always a pleasure shopping on Amazon it save me time and energy and it's amazing the deals they have.,5,1
Frequent user. App works fairly well but deleting items in your list is a bit sluggish. Also don't like the alexa icon not being a choice. Love to see an option for that as I do not use it and would like to remove it from my view.,4,1
Whatever policy Google cooked up that keeps me from buying Kindle books in the app is stupid. That has been my primary use for having the app on my phone. Change it back.,1,-1
"Please unblock my account. I literally forgot my password and now I can't log in or contact amazon because there is no contact information? I have tried for several weeks and I still can't get into my account, it is not being hacked or ANYTHING!!!! I FORGOT MY PASSWORD SO PLEASE UNBLOCK IT SO THAT I CAN FREELY USE AMAZON WITHOUT ANY MORE PROBLEMS BECASE THE CUSTOMER SERVISE IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS. THANK YOU FOR NOTHING",1,-1
"Makes shopping super easy, and that can be good and bad at the same time. So many tempting options. Like it, but it makes spending your money too easy.",5,1
Just so the every day person knows Amazon rarely if ever read these reviews. You'll get further if you send an email through developer contact.,1,-1
"Love the product variety! But the app itself has become infuriating to use, it's constantly freezing up and everything takes a very long time to load. It's incredibly irritating",2,1
Order history purposely broken so it makes it more difficult or impossible to return items. Amazon knows most purchases are done via smartphone so they purposely work bugs into return feature so return window passes.,1,-1
I love Amazon! They always have what I need and it saves me time and money. With gas prices being so high I save a lot shopping from home.,5,1
"After the changes to their application for Android smartphones, I hardly use the computer to find and order what I need. The search features are great, even for older users like myself. And anytime your not sure, the assistant can help you do almost anything. Even getting a return processed, or looking for a missing order, it's all quick and easy.",5,1
I never need to leave my home because of Amazon. I don't get people germs... nobody is ever mean to me...I don't get negative energy. this is the greatest invention since sliced bread. good job Amazon. Thanks for helping this indigo humans existence easier. Much love to all,5,1
Kinda alright. Anytime you order something to a new address though they will take it upon themselves to send it to your old address even if you select your new one. Thanks. I'll never get my package  miles away amazon.,1,-1
"I love shopping @ Amazon especially on my lazy days... there are always great prices, good quality, and easy returns if you're unhappy with the products.",5,1
Great prices and huge savings on anything you need or want defiantly will recommend to anyone who is looking for great deals and savings,5,1
It's great on finding what you need at good prices but I wish it was easy to find the original item of what you want.,4,1
Never had any issues with them amazon are great if got send it for items or returned items not that iv not sent much back there very helpful for anything you order lots of choice,5,1
"This app has been a phenomenal thing until the last three months or so. I can see stuff, search stuff, and order stuff but I cannot see my current or past orders. It looks like it is going to load and then just stays a blank white screen. To check inhave to login to the website through a browser (st world problem, I know). Please fix. Thank you.",3,-1
LOVE IT! Nothing you cant get on amazon and with prime you can get most things delivered the next day. Site is easy to use and navigate and items can be returned really easily in local convenience stores if needed.,5,1
"it's hard to fault Amazon, I'm constantly amazed at the vast range of products that you can purchase at their online store, their speed of delivery and just about everything is competively priced. their returns policy is also very good, it's simple and easy to follow. As a prime member I save hand over fist where delivery charges are concerned and there is also all of the extra TV programmes and movies that are included too!",5,1
"First place I go to for anything and everything. I've been a Prime customer for a million years and it's worth every penny. Great app, excellent return and exchange policies, easy to use app and easy to return or exchange whatever. Love love love Amazon. No I am not a bot lol.",5,1
Everytime I purchase something online through my tv it always says the payments are declined. Then when I try to purchase it on the app it says declined. Only the rd time that I click on the payment method on the app will it work. This had been going on for months. Very frustrating.,2,-1
No more buying books on the app? You say it's Google but how hard can it be. Quite hard apparently because when I Google Amazon.co.uk it flings me back to the app! Fix this!,2,-1
love the ap. so easy to use and I can just pick up my phone and order something when I need to. choosing a delivery day of week saves money on shipping and you get rewards too.,5,1
Fast and easy shopping with the same low price as the discount stores with the added bonus that they deliver to your doorstep. Doesn't get any better or easier..,5,1
"it's usually pretty good but like today, I received something different from what I ordered. shipping is usually what they say..",4,1
"So bad won't even tell me the price of the item I clicked on until I go to checkout I don't know why anyone would use this instead of ebay, ebay has way better deals too!",1,-1
"I get disappointed when I order things and the delivery dates change to one or two days later than they state. If I wanted something, I'd like to get it as soon as possible!",1,-1
I hate that it keeps changing the apps language based on my region. Just stick to what I set it to. ITS ANNOYING NOT PRACTICAL. I don't suddenly prefer to speak French just cause I'm located at a different place. It's a Stupid feature.,1,-1
can't delete annoying try before you buy ad/cart.,1,-1
Glitchy and hard to navigate. The influencer videos pop up everywhere and even I try to close the videos everything turns black,2,-1
"Stop shipping packages with USPS, they never arrive on time, and are always at least  days late then when expected. If they stopped using USPS, would give  stars.",2,-1
"The app works as intended most of the time. Sadly I miss out on some lightning deals due to a no notification message but, other then that it works great.",4,1
I just Love Amazon Shopping. Service is great and my goods are always on time. Overall a good online shopping experience.,5,1
"The orders page never loads in the app or the chrome browser. I have to go to a computer and use edge browser in private mode to review my orders. Very frustrating. I keep thinking this will be fixed in an update, it's been weeks and still not fixed.",1,-1
"Had amazon prime for a while now and this review is not about the app, the app works good but Amazon itself is getting worse, prime doesn't get your items quicker so what's the point of paying for it, and the most annoying thing is that they offer false advertisement, that's why I wrote this review, they advertise that you item will be deliver the next day if you buy within a set time limit but then you don't get it the next it happened twice already, false advertisement is annoying to me..",3,-1
"They have a lovely new policy that if a package is stolen they can't do anything because it was ""delivered"" to the address even if they didn't follow the simple instructions you leave in the comment section... so now I'm out money, after years of being a subscriber, horrible.",1,-1
"Ive had a lot of trouble with costumer service saying theyre gonna send ups to pick a package up & return it for weeks now I eventually got tired of waiting on ups to come so I put it in a drop box thinking surely theyd pick it up there & told Amazon I put it there but no. I got ahold of ups to see when theyd stop by to pick packages up they said Id have to deal with Amazon, Amazon said they'd send someone & Id have to talk to the delivery guy its been back & forth its irritating Im out $ish",2,-1
"Upsetting that they raised the price of the Prime membership, a bit ridiculous as it's already expensive. however I do enjoy using Amazon prime and have had good customer service",5,1
i find the amazon shopping app extremely convient and easy to browse or find exactly what you need.also you find alot of good deals and fast shipping,5,1
"Every time I try to use the app, Amazon keeps telling me something went wrong. Even the home page crashes to the error message after a few seconds. Tried clearing cache and even reinstalling but same issue.",1,-1
I love the convenience of shopping at home along with so many great prices.. Excellent customer service communication when needed and even if or when you are dissatisfied with any products Amazon always makes it right.. I just love the freedom of shopping with a great company I have grown to trust!!!! Amazon shopping Thank you for always being # and always a great at home shopping experience!!!!! You have thousands and thousands of choices of everything you may need or desire no matter what!!!!,5,1
"BRING BACK THE MUSIC PURCHASE/PREVIEW OPTIONS!! I'M ***NOT*** BUYING INTO YOUR STUPID UNLIMITED NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU HARASS ME ABOUT IT. IT'S A JOKE/SCAM. Have just discovered I can no longer preview or even purchase music via the app. I googled this and don't know how I dodged this problem this long - I'm seeing complaints going back  -  years. And the ""workaround"" is to use the website...in a browser...on my phone...when THE APP USED TO PERFORM THIS FUNCTION JUST FINE??? W. T. F.",1,-1
"Cannot get into opening screen; I just see a dog and a ""Uh-Oh, something went wrong on our end"" message.",2,-1
Great app overall. It has all the features you would expect from an online shopping platform. I like unique features such as Buy Again. My biggest gripe and the reason for a  star deduction is the reviews. The very thing that kept me coming back to the platform early on. The shear amount of fraudulent/bought reviews makes me loose confidence in the platform. The nd is their allowance of blatantly fake items; Blue Maple Tree seeds for example. They don't take down even when reported!,4,-1
"Something wrong with your app it keeps disabling on my dashboard and then I have to redownload the app, and it's not my phone...",1,-1
shopping on Amazon is very easy for me and convenient. When I am at work I can keep track of my package. So Amazon helps me out with my shopping,5,1
The app is not for browsing and most stuff is so cheaply made with no option to find higher end stuff without searching. With Amazon money they could do better,1,-1
"It would earn  stars from me if they would disclose a better estimate on the arrival date. I understand there may be issues, but all my orders are late this month and some parts I required for work. It's ok to be late, please update your arrival dates to reflect. Overall about the app, it's still convenient. I would rather give it  stars.",4,-1
App is having difficulty working on my android s+ ultra. I keep getting difficulty something went wrong on our end. Used to be only off wifi but now it's saying it all the time.,2,-1
"I love shopping on Amazon. I have had no issues with any orders and if I had to return anything, it went without any problems.",5,1
Shady business. Opened a credit card through them and they auto switched my prime membership to the credit card. Why would I want to pay interest on my monthly membership that has always been on my debit card.  day shipping is a joke as half the time there is always some delay. Worst streaming service out there. % B or worse movies.,1,-1
Cant seem to purchase music anymore. Says it cant be purchased from my device. Which is odd to me. This needs to be fixed.,1,-1
"Esp now with the price of fuel unstable and so high as a delivery driver for medical needs, I can definitely appreciate the the lack of pavement needled to purchase some of the best products in often less time than driving to shop in crowded places.",4,-1
"I love Amazon, stops me from having to go shopping in stores. I can always return my items with UPS pick up at my house . I probably spend way to much . however everything I need or want is just a click away. some things can be misleading so read the reviews and details guys",4,1
So easy to use both for purchasing and returning items. Crazy fast. The app almost never had any issue. I keep wanting to buy more consciously from local/fair trade/eco friendly sources but Amazon makes it so easy and cheap by comparison that it's a hard to abandon.,5,1
I love making use of the Amazon prime you get things so much faster. my only issue is when they use royal mail for delivery when they have there owe delivery service,5,1
Quick service. Huge range to choose from. Free shipping with Amazon Prime is a bonus!,5,1
"The app si phenomenal even if they try to show you only the promoted and they're oun stuff first almost all the products have a good or very good review. So even they ""force"" you to buy only certain things the quality/money is god if not excellent. Keep up the good work ",4,1
Favorite online store.,5,1
This is awful since the update. The orders section changed and now I can never get it to properly show my orders. It just never refreshes. Go back to the old orders section please. The current is NOT better.,1,-1
I bought  items via Amazon Egypt. I got  damaged items and  wrong item. I am not going to use this miserable service again. Worst online shopping experience ever !,1,-1
"I love this app, my wife suffers from anxiety and sometimes can't leave home , this app allows her to get products she needs quickly and with minimal effort",5,1
Amazon delivers! I'm older so it really makes my day go by faster to shop online. It's kinda entertaining because I love to shop but can't stand going to the stores anymore. Amazon gets it right and I'm so glad I started shopping on their website.,5,1
"What's to say. Everyone knows Amazon rules. So, of course their app will be easy to navigate, add items to cart, move items from cart to a buy it later section, and their shipping is usually very fast, even -Day shipping sometimes! If there's ever a problem with an order, it's easy to either contact them to solve the issue or to get a refund or store credit when something arriives broken or doesn't arrive at all if stolen. Amazon's just the best.",5,1
"App is great. However I have always written reviews for my purchases using the app, since I often rely on others' reviews. Amazon suddenly blocked me from writing reviews and removed all my prior reviews and won't communicate with me about WHY??!! I haven't called because I'm a busy woman. Bad customer service.",3,-1
Awesome app so many items at such amazing prices. Find items that you have a hard time finding anywhere else I just absolutely love it it makes my life so much easier,5,1
"Don't ever use Amazon Fresh! I had an order placed, they indicated it shipped, and  minutes after the window I checked to see that they had canceled my order with no communication on the subject. When I went to resubmit it they couldn't deliver it until late the following day rather than when I actually needed the product. I'll schedule my time to go to the grocery store rather than wait for a service that screws you over.",1,-1
So far everything is all well and to expectations! Had a few lil issues and it's fixed or answered that same call. Thank You keep up the good work.,5,1
excellent application for faster shopping and shipping is faster...issues I've been couple time but costumer service help me with my shopping items..,4,1
awesome place to find exactly what your looking for and then some for the right price comparing price and quality under one roof without leaving the comfort of your own living space. got to love it.,5,1
shopping with Amazon is very quick and easy. It's actually fun to place an order and in just a few steps I have my order delivered.,5,1
"convenient shopping, easy saving favorites or ideas to shopping lists and easy returns. Mostly love shopping with Amazon! Just be careful with vendors you buy from like anywhere else. But returns are usually so easy it's not a huge deal if you make a mistake with them.",5,1
"I love amazon.. I have amazon prime and if my package doesnt arrive in a timely manner they refund it for you, you dont have to do anything... Customer service is great and your options are endless",5,1
It couldn't be easier to shop at Amazon. com. The search engine takes me directly to the items I want. Checkout is easy too.,5,1
"I don't know what happened, just one day I got a notification saying a payment didn't go thru , and i opened it confused, cuz that payment had already gone thru. And it showed me that error page that refreshes with cute dogs. It hasn't worked since, I even removed and then reinstalled and then updated the app. It just stopped working. :(",1,-1
"Amazon is an easy shopping experience. They have just about everything. I took away two stars because I have noticed lately that the prices are going up. Which I understand everything is going up right now, but offen times I can get many of these items cheaper at Sam's Club or Walmart. And they also have free delivery, so they are just as convenient as Amamzon now.",3,1
I am a avid shopper on Amazon. I trust the operation and I like the selection of products. And they are fast on delivery. easy pay with my store card and my Amazon credit card. I been buying products for  years now and never had a issue with anything. it's very important to leave ratings and feedback on the products that you purchase it help everyone make a decision and guides and help others to make and choose the best fit for what they are looking to buy.,5,1
"I LOVE Amazon shopping! Im disabled at the moment and its so convenient. I always double check the prices against Walmart and majority of the time, they are cheaper. Whatever you buy, ive learned, to check the reviews, check info of product like material or dimensions.",5,1
"The search engine gets worse with every update. I don't think it's faulty, I think it's rigged in order to generate more profit. And now to make things worse you have to put up with a shopping list pop-up every time you view something. Pathetic.",1,-1
"app is heavy loading, slow, freezing overall has some issues on Android phones. That's my  different phone in using it on",3,-1
I do all my shopping on Amazon. How awesome to have everything delivered right to your door. Those delivering my packages are always very careful and thoughtful.,5,1
I have been a Prime member for  years and became handicapped with no transportation  years ago and what I have saved in shipping alone having Prime membership is well worth it. I haven't had problems with any products or delivery. The problems I have had with clothes sizes were my own fault lol.,5,1
"What a complete PITA piece of bloatware. Lacks functionality of web shopping, automatically opens at annoying times. Wish we could delete it.",1,-1
"Amazon have taken better care of me as a buyer these days than most online suppliers, i have felt safe in my purchases and have grown to prefer Amazon to ebay massively. Definitely recommend Amazon",5,1
App is frustrating. It blanks out pages and makes ordering frustrating. Goes to that page with a random dog making me go back to the home page. Most often when linking from email and really common when ordering my food. The app may be requiring permissions I have blocked with antivirus. That is a problem. I also notice a lower performance when using a VPN. That is another problem. This is a cut & paste code problem. Do better.,2,-1
used to be a great service. I feel like I pay for a service and I don't receive any value for the membership. I can order on Amazon without prime and will receive the shipme t sooner.,3,-1
Amazon has been really good so convenient when you can't always go to the store and go shopping. I love that you can also use your EBT card to get some food things in bulk. Definitely great for ordering gifts as well. I also like how if I order more than one thing in a day they group my orders together. only  or  times have we had an issue with receiving an item.,5,1
"Amazon app is turning into a hot dumpster fire. Constantly crashing, never loading, customer service constantly being hidden so you can't locate it. Constant rearranging of the app so things are confusing. ""Your orders"" section will never load. Get it together Amazon, and quit changing things around and put it back the way it was. Nobody wants to have to play games to find and get customer service.",1,-1
Best Place To Order Everything You Need. I have been ordering all my supplies and everything else through Amazon for over  years. Anything you need they have it and highly recommend it. I'm one happy customer.,5,1
"Excellent service, extremely reliable company, excellent work. I recommend it millions of times, you can trust it! I have been a prime customer for  years, since .",5,1
absolutely love Amazon!!. I did have a few issues before with a package not arriving but as soon as I got in contact with Amazon's they either refunded me or sent out the same thing again free of charge  can always rely on certain products from Amazon but not everything is perfect,5,1
Some products are way to expensive I ordered trash bags on the th they never showed and now their making me wait until the th for them to refund my money that's fraud! Mind you this package hasn't moved anywhere!,1,-1
Been a Prime member since the beginning. makes it so easy when you think of something you need you can review items. Create a wish list. When need something fast just buy now.,5,1
"I can't find at local stores what I need and want like I can on Amazon. especially the quantity, quality and price! delivery always on time if not sooner ! join Prime and the free shipping makes it all worth it",5,1
I have been using Amazon for all my shopping needs. It's quick and convenient. I haven't been to a brick and mortar store in years. Groceries and anything you can think of is available and delivered right to my door. Best app I've ever used. You will be pleased.,5,1
"I have been using Amazon for about  years including prime. , sometimes  day shipping really can't be beat. sometimes the pricing on amazon is a tad higher than other suppliers, but the shipping alone is worth it.",5,1
I've been shopping with Amazon for over  yr and have been very satisfied. If ever I had any problems with shipping or product issues the customer service reps have always been very helpful. I will continue shoppie with amazon.,5,1
This is shopping made easy. This is the site I use for items that I have a hard time finding locally. They have great selection of products and great prices as well.,5,1
"Amazon shopping is kool, I've never had any issues, and the customer service is good!..",5,1
"I enjoy using the Amazon app, it has access to the tabs I need. Searching for items is easy and the selection is spot on. I enjoy the prime options and the  day shipping on most items. I also like the instant coupon savings, and the payment options. Versatile options and large selections. Highly recommend trying it out.",5,1
"Convenient and easy to use. Love the ability to save lists for later. Amazon's app is the gold standard all online retailers should aspire to. I've literally purchased things on Amazon will walking around Target, because it was convenient and easy to find an order on amazon. Meanwhile myself and the employees couldn't figure out what was going on with the Target app or in the store. Delivery next day from Amazon. What's not to love. There's a reason Jeff Bezos is wealthy: his website just works.",5,1
"easy to navigate, products seem to originate mainly from China, would like to see more made in USA items. saves shipping and payme t details for easy transaction.",5,1
"I love Amazon! I have only ever had  problem in all the years I've used them and it wasn't even directly with them. I love that you can find pretty much anything your looking for, great deals, great customer service, delivery is made by responsible and professional drivers who show your home respect. I refer anyone I can to them.",5,1
"DARK MODE this is a really great app makes things a lot easier,it's just a click and go but they really need to put a dark mode on this app please I mostly use it at night and even with brightness down low it still gives me a massive headache. Please fix it soon  ",5,-1
Great app & service! Amazon makes shopping easy with their user-friendly interface and you can always count on their efficient service. Things always arrive on time and well packaged.,5,1
App repeatedly freezes and stops working. It's nearly impossible to use.,2,-1
Amazon is so fast and easy. I save hundreds on shipping. Amazing service they provide. I've been a customer for  years.,5,1
I like Amazon and I appreciate how quickly they fix issues with products. I just wish you could pick your prime membership parts. like we don't use the music or a few other options but we pay for them.,5,1
MUCH better since the last time i uninstalled and reinstalled it. Would be so much easier to get my orders done if there's NOT so many adds that pop up in my way every  seconds,5,1
Quick service. Easy on returns,5,1
Super easy especially with my Amazon Prime account. I dispise the rate increase but love the accessibility and seamless ordering.,5,1
prime is a rip off but they make you pay for it with shipping cost anyways. seriously wouldn't use this app if you can buy what your looking for within an hours drive.,2,-1
"excellent platform, all features work great on good handsets. I have stuck with Samsung and never had any issues.",5,1
"Convenient way to get all things I need delivered to my front door. Never a hassle, always delivered professionally and on time. Highly recommended.",5,1
So when AMAZON advertises something and the order is full they have absolutely NO regard to filling the order. They blame it on the seller even though AMAZON is the seller and AMAZON takes payment and AMAZON ships hence order. If there was a better way to buy I would this is why I left eBay and will be looking for a new company to come around and when they do I will can all Amazon purchases. until then I'm stuck.,1,-1
I love this app and have had it on my new phone but it broke so now I'm using my S and the version is higher than what I need to download but I can't download it it just stops downloading I need help PLEASE FIX THIS THING!!!!!!,5,1
Never had any problems with this App. Works great. Get notifications on my orders in Gmail and able to track orders thru the app.,5,1
":::Beware Amazon is a scammers paradise::: I rather pay shipping fees than join prime but get blasted to ""join prime"" ads. the prime subscription fee is too steep for what it is and for someone that doesn't use Amazon as much... every time open the Amazon app I get a pop up asking me to join again... no thanks... it's annoying so I leave the app and use something less pushy...",1,-1
"The Amazon Shopping app is easy to navigate, fun to use, and it has many different categories to shop through. I have personally used the app for years, and have never encountered any significant issues.",4,1
"love this Amazon app. not all things are the cheapest. but most convenient when needing things for your family, home, lawn garden in a timely manner. thank you Amazon emplyees for all your hard work delivering the products.  stars all day every day!!",5,1
"Poor Device control Canada based. Access to device renaming and controls for Fire Sticks and devices is non existent or minimal compared to U.S., even in browser. Please give us the same connectivity and options in Canada as the U.S.",1,-1
"I'm only giving  stars because the search function is so so so bad. you put in a product / manufacturer name, it auto suggests the complete title, you accept then it shows you everything but that manufacturer. it will drive you bonkers. it is like they assume everybody is a skinflint and offers a lot of cheap tat instead of the manufacturer you searched for. if you are looking for cheap tat and you want it the next day... hands-down the best option.",3,-1
". A very misleading price policy. I always see a lower listing price but as soon as I click on the item for details the price multiplies or suddenly isn't available to my destination but I can have it for a higher price. A cheap clickbait strategy. . Probably the worst searching browser in the world. This Amazon policy to push noname ""featured"" staff to first places and not what I searched for drives me crazy. . How to change from Amazon.xx to Amazon.yy and back without reinstalling the app?",1,-1
I like this app but it is slow and could be better it seems like its not optimized for older OS and Phones. But on newer devices it is fast and works good.,4,1
Customer service is always helpful in resolving issues. Sellers are good at communicating. The app is easy to navigate for everything from shopping to wish lists.,5,1
Lots of great value found within Amazon Canada shopping... tough to beat. Some items such as home improvement / hardware are still a bit pricey. Virtually everything's available within Canada except perishable groceries. Hopefully we'll see that in the future soon. The variety of overall choice is amazing. Amazon Prime benefits definitely add up to be worth it if you shop exclusively on Amazon. Customer service is the absolute epitome of professionalism. Highly recommended shopping experience.,5,1
"love amazon. Never failed me for the last few years I shop on their website. Shipping is fast. Products come in good condition, never received wrong items. Highly recommend.",5,1
App constantly has issues when looking for too long.. it'll reset your choices and you stay at beginning instead of seeing what you search for. PLUS NO WAY TO TURN OFF ANNOYING SALES SHOWS! THEY USE EXTRA BATTERY AND DATA,1,-1
"love the convince of shopping at your finger b tips and either buying right then and there, or if I got distracted ...can come back to it later on.",5,1
"Amazon is the best. I've NEVER had an issue purchasing, returning or collecting a refund. Great all around & extremely convenient!",5,1
oh my goodness..I'm addicted to Amazon shopping. I want a delivery every day. Easy to navigate. Millions of choices. I'm with Amazon prime so I get free delivery and also enjoy some great films/programmes. Life made so much easier..why wouldn't love it?,5,1
convenient and good prices.,4,1
"One stop place for almost anything. Amazon has been instrumental in my survival during the Corona Apocalypse. They have a great customer service center, quick to respond to any and all issues or complaints. The app itself is very easy to navigate and offers help, security and quick access to anything you're shopping for.",5,1
Have shopped via Amazon for a number of years now and so far so good. Buy now is easy and returns are very easy too.,4,-1
"lots of items are ok , but there's a lot of junk . I find if you want high end quality items you won't find it here on Amazon , you have to buy it directly from the company or manufacturer . Basically the high-end of the junk is ok !",3,1
Amazon hasn't been able to provide goat milk even though it's on the site as one of their Amazon fresh items. And some times they don't have what I put in my cart which causes a switch to something that's totally not what I ordered which I understand is better than nothing but if all items were always there and correct I would give up five stars. but four stars is great service so hopefully Amazon fresh keeps it up. I like that delivery is free.,4,1
"I opened the app today and it was all in Spanish. How did it get changed? And when you don't know Spanish, how the hell are you supposed to know what to click in order to change the language setting?! It was very difficult indeed!!! I clicked many many links not knowing what I was looking at or looking for. Eventually I googled it, but I shouldn't of had to. Why not make the change language link in ENGLISH so people can find it. That's so stupid to have the change in the same language asallelse.",3,-1
Well designed and built application. Some result lists do not present options in a clear manner and filters do not always work on the results.,4,-1
"variety at good prices. wish returns and reviews can be updated however. few items I had issues with after a week, can't get her returning them.",4,-1
Amazon shopping is great. and if you must return a item for refund or credit..its done quickly..with in hrs.. especially if you are a PRIME MEMBER..,5,1
"Abysmal Performance. Past orders are unbearably slow to load, as is using the Whole Foods delivery functionality. Also, I've had issues with / of my orders this year- a lot, considering I moved into a new home, so habe been using Amazon quite a lot. Customer service, which is outsourced, out of CONUS, is mostly useless. Given I now have access to many big box retailers, who offer delivery, I am seriously considering canceling my Prime account.",2,-1
"I hate the influencers & alexa button- have not found a way to remove/hide/disable. The app loads & runs incredibly slow on my older phone so I rarely want to use it anymore. It's also a data hog and I am considering removing it permanently which basically means I'll rarely, if ever, shop on Amazon anymore.",2,1
love this app and store I can get what I need and variety at that. awesome reasonable prices and delivery time is great. I recommend to everyone including home bodies that hate to get out,5,1
" star customer service team, on time deliveries, easy browsing with online platform, and there is no no doubt that Amazon will make every effort to make sure a customer leaves and feel satisfied shopping here. Go team Amazon, great job!",5,1
"I love me some Amazon! Everyone who knows me gets me Amazon gift cards for Christmas and my birthday and Mother's Day. They always have what I'm looking for, the prices are great and the shipping is very quick! I would love to work there just for the employee discount! Plus, their customer service is second to none!! If you are unhappy with a transaction they do everything possible to make it right. They take very good care of their customers!! p.s. become a Prime member for even better deals!!",5,1
"This is the easiest way to shop. I love that I can categorize and save things for later. In doing so, I am able to plan designs according to rooms for my home or a wish list for clothing. I even made a category for last minute gifts. Another perk is having the option of auto delivery with my supplements. Amazon is definitely making my life easier.",5,1
Good app. Order every week. Easy to navigate. Returns easy. I like Amazon monitors sellers during returns.,5,1
"This app is almost unstable, consistently get ""uh oh something went wrong"" which nullifies my searches and my cart. I am now sadly going back to eBay just to avoid repurchasing the same thing due to ""whoops"" and only a sad dog face.... Not to mention how bad Prime is becoming with the inflated price yet they seem to have a warehouse EVERYWHERE. Corporate greed is becoming so easily attainable with the docile people we've become :(",2,-1
"Very easy, you can find absolutely anything. prices are competitive and a lot of times less.",5,1
Worst Amazon.in customer service. Order some items and didn't received the delivery till date waited for  to  more days but not yet received than automatic it shows returning to seller from last  weeks and no refunds yet customer service is worst delivery is worst not at all excepted by Amazon. Really disappointed.,1,-1
"The newest download on the app must not be set up perfectly, but its a simple and easy way to find things you're looking for instead of driving everywhere to different stores and whatnot",4,1
Love my Amazon Prime! The convenience of same day delivery makes up for the annual price increase. Every consumer wants to reap benefits and Amazon definitely delivers results of great prices and benefits for consumers and businesses!,5,1
Love it convenient prices are usually comparable sometimes even better than the grocery store and they usually have quite a variety of a specific item,5,1
"I don't know what I would do without Amazon Shopping! Definitely quality items and I always find what I want. Everything is nicely made. I never had a problem with quality! I also never had a problem with quantity for the price Definitely great! My reason for a  star  is some clothing is very hard to purchase- I am not a Barbie Doll -still great materials, awesome Everything   ️",4,1
Love amazon except for the fact that half their delivery people never actually leave things at our front doors. We have to go on a scavenger hunt in our community to find our packages.,4,-1
"Amazon is not the least expensive place to shop, look for alternate vendor pricing before assuming this is your best vendor. Many Amazon third-party vendors have ridiculously high pricing and long ship times, look at the item, pricing and details in when expected to ship before making your purchase.",3,-1
Amazon is always my first place to shop for everything!! Ran out of an important supplement and Amazon got it to me the same day! They're awesome!,5,1
"love Amazon, easy to use app, lots of selection, reviews easy to understand.",5,1
"Used to be better. Used to have good deals, and excellent customer service. Now the prices aren't as good and the service is all automated.",4,1
"If you can think of it, Amazon's got it. Competitive pricing from different suppliers is definitely a benefit, with a little searching of course. For the maximum benefit, pay for the Prime membership, the BENEFITS far outweigh the subscription cost. A no-questions-asked return/refund policy ensures you're always satisfied with your purchases (Tip: Use the product with discretion and keep the box/packaging till you're sure of your purchase, for the benefit of the next customer).",5,1
i love convenience of shopping with Amazon. But they need to get better delivery drivers. Been too many issues with my deliveries past  months.,4,1
"I love buying from Amazon. the products quality is good and at affordable price. sometimes you get a a bad quality item, but for the most, I am very satisfied with everything I have bought from here.",5,1
"Amazon Shopping is a fairly good app for purchasing from Amazon. The search algorithm is definitely more preferential to select products and you are shown fewer results than using a web browser. Also without signing in to Amazon in a web browser, you will get a better variety of results.",4,1
The app itself works pretty well but it is lacking with not having a section for returns. Having to scroll through my orders to find the return is horrible. If you are processing multiple returns from multiple orders it resets you back to the latest order you did.,2,-1
I always find what I am looking for and able to browse just to see what I can find plus not only does it comes to me I can have it delivered to other addresses normally get the item  to  days and sometimes get the items before it says it will be here I can keep on and on I have got other people hooked because of the satisfaction that I get,5,1
I like ordering from Amazon the prices are great but very disappointing when you go to order a product and when looking it says order now and get item today between :am and :pm. You place order and then the system shows estimated delivery tomorrow between :pm and :pm please just be honest about the delivery so I can make an informed decision.,3,-1
"On Samsung Galaxy Ultra G recently App stop functioning....wont start up, keep crashing unexpectedly when opening app, uninstall, reinstall, clear cache/data, restart phone so far no fix....so for mean time its uninstalled till the app is fully functioning again... EDIT: just installed and app is working as normal...Great! Thanks for the fix in app hiccup.",5,1
"political views aside, amazon shopping is super easy if you pay attention to seller names and read reviews bad to good. stores have been out of toddler food the last few months and I am lucky enough to still be able to get what my son needs with his allergies on Amazon. same price as the store. I wouldn't really recommend buying clothes unless you are % sure of the brand name. overall between the - day shipping and the free prime video included you can't beat the price of the membership.",5,1
"Fast, safe, easy shopping. It is rare that I don't find what I'm looking for! So far any exchange or return has gone smoothly. Will continue to shop with them.",5,1
"I love Amazon Shopping! I am disabled and it's very hard for me to walk or stand, especially in line to pay or whatever. With Amazon I can order almost anything I need and it will show up at my front door sometimes the very same day! If an item shows up and for some reason It wasn't what I thought it would be or it was damaged or whatever I just return it(most items). The policies, warranty info etc. are plainly stated and I you can always contact Customer Service with any other problems.",5,1
"I have not received my parcel still after  days of delivery attempt, customer service agents not able to solve my problem as they know problem. Not good delivery service.",1,-1
"it's Amazon... seriously... Amazon... they do a good job. you don't have to like them, but again... they seem to do a really good job.",5,1
"honest,fast and if product isnt complete or not as advertised it doesn't cost you a penny  ship it back. I have been satisfied shopping on Amazon and will continue.",5,1
Amazon has made things so much easier for me on being able to get things that I need or want. because it's kinda hard for me to always get to a store.,5,1
"I just love Amazon prime, easier, faster, better. save me so much time and energy, I can just lay on my bed and find everything I need, create my own outfit right there and then. Just wonderful.",5,1
"If I'm on fb, ig, or Google and I what to click on a product I want to view it doesn't take me to the product link. It takes me to Amazon home screen. You have to press back click back on the product and keep doing it until you get to the product link. It LITERALLY takes me at most - tries to get to the right screen. It is VERY annoying & frustrating! It wasn't always like this, it started about  months ago. They need to go to the old app or fix it or something!",2,-1
"Tried to make my first purchase and they put a hold on it and I can't figure out what they want to verify that the card belongs to me cause I don't use a physical bank, I use a debit card that my boss used to direct deposit my paychecks onto and I have a cheap phone and it doesn't do any screenshots of anything I have been trying to figure it out. Why do they do that on someone's very first purchase and I can't even get onto customer service in anyway possible",1,-1
"I research around but finally buy it from Amazon app, lot of savings, very easy return process (peace of mind) and no regrets!!",5,1
"Needs a separate prime shipping account... I dont use prime video, but my price is increasing... I just want free shipping, not terrible movies and shows...",3,-1
"wish there were more products that were made in the USA, or at least not China (also needs to be easier to tell what country its made in--you have to play detective to able to find where it's made, if at all)",3,-1
I love shopping on Amazon!! They make it super easy to order and delivery times are fast. I'm one happy customer.,5,1
"i like Amazon, they are dependable. I can find things that are the brands I trust at lower costs. returns are easy and the refunds are quick. I also, don't really go out much, I'm not a crowd type person, so I can trust Amazon for my needs.",5,1
"Amazon's search engine is very intuitive. When you're not quite sure what to call something you're interested in OR you just want some suggestions, you'll find the search tool quite helpful.",5,1
"Other than the increasing prices, which aren't in Amazon's control, my only complaint is that not many items can be received the next day anymore. Otherwise the shopping experience is quick and easy!",5,1
"I can't download a pdf receipt on the app. So dumb and basic. Support just tells you everything you already know. They say click on your orders and hit the download receipt button... except, there isn't one!",1,-1
"Despite Amazon's poor reputation, their app works great. All of the functions work correctly with a smooth experience.",5,1
"I really appreciate all that Amazon has to offer, from online shopping to Prime movies and music. I find the membership fees to be a good value!",5,1
"Easy to use app. View purchase history, shop a huge selection of items. Excellent customer service.",5,1
"My review won't mean squat but here it is. I have recently been denied the privilege of leaving product reviews, asking questions about an item, etc., due to an apparent review that didn't follow guidelines. Amazon won't let me know which one it was & they chose to ignore my inquiries. NOW, I can't even ask a seller a question if I have a problem with an item! Still don't know what I did to cause this. But they will damn sure take my money! Amazon sucks!!!",1,-1
love shopping with Amazon because of the two days shipping and sometimes even next day shipping and also the price of the item are great and because I'm an Amazon prime member I get to enjoy there movies and shows.,5,1
"Its A system That Works!!! You Order It, It Shows Up, Its Wrong They Take Back and Fix The Issue In Record Time And!!!! Gives Jobs To Our Local People",5,1
"I would rather shop with Amazon, than stand in line at the store. You go to the store for a certain item, and they did not update their inventory. So you made a wasted trip. Got home, went online with Amazon, and had my item in a day or two",5,1
A fully functional app. Never had any issues. It's great to be able to track deliveries. Also good that search results from Google open directly on the app.,5,1
"addicted to Amazon. love it! I find the greatest deals, and prices are better than most stores. Amazing!!",5,1
"I was a little plausible using Amazon because I'm not very savi with internet but once I started and realized my details and money is safe... I started using it... but when I realized if I'm not happy with my purchase, Amazon make it easy to return... so it's a bit like going to a shopping mall and feeling and touching the item before you make up your mind... absolutely brilliant and very fast service if your on Amazon prime.",5,1
"so quick, easy & reliable, as long as you use common sense when ordering from outside UK 🇬🇧.",5,1
"Ever since they brought buying books for comixology here, it's a much much MUCH smaller selection of comics and much harder to find. The filters still initially try to make you buy the paperback version first as well. Hope they figure this out soon as several months have gone by and it's completely ruined the comic experience.",1,-1
"I love to shop on line with Amazon. Everything that I have ordered is fantastic. If something is not right, Amazon will make it right. Returns are fast and easy. If you have any item which you do not like, or is damaged, Amazon is quick to intercede in your behalf. The staff is wonderful, kind, and very professional.",5,1
very convenient to use when shopping in a store as it makes it very easy to check and compare prices and to place an order when I come across a great deal.,5,1
This has been my go to shopping place. The app is easy to use and I prefer shopping on it rather then my computer. I highly recommend this app.,5,1
"UPDATE: Just updated the app and it's horrible. Freezes, product links don't work, can't view my entire cart, etc. Very intuitive and user friendly. Addictive and convenient. Prime is definitely worth the cost for frequent shoppers. I can find most anything here.",1,-1
"Too much information, I do not want people contacting me... If I want a product, I'll find what I want and buy it, bombard me with ads and I never buy from them..",1,-1
Absolutely love it especially after I lost my mobility due to spinal arthritis and covid hitting the world  my kids have it a bit easier these days too!,4,1
Shopping is made easier delivery is fast and secure. workers on the back end need major props with out them profits drop. over all thank you for great service,5,1
The app has usually been good but in the last week it doesn't work correctly. There is no order page and the cart doesn't show. It is impossible to check order statuses. I have started just going online because the app is useless right now. Not sure what happened but not loving it right now.,3,-1
"As I am getting older, shopping on line is much easier for me than going from store to store. But I was always a catalog shopper when I was young also.",5,1
"it's a gift and a curse that there's so many independent vendors on here. hard to tell good from bad, real from fake... but prime is the best way to go for online shopping still",4,1
"Nothing beats Amazon when it comes to affordability, customer care, and making Chinese goods more really available in America without having to wait forever on shipments. Go Amazon!",5,1
"Very very poor customer services, no proper responses. Hard to get a person who knows the issues to handle, then immediately say, some one calls you, it will never happened, they will say we are connecting unless you are getting irritated and run away from there. You are with false promises in their website, no proper responses or attentions I think responsible persons from the company look in to thosej. In this way, this as usual happening now, many of the people will keep distance from you.",1,-1
App non responsive on Android . No internet connection error although my wifi signal is excellent. Needs an update to fix this.,1,-1
I love amazon! using prime I get faster and free shipping. Anything you need you can get it at home or wherever you want it.,5,1
"Easy as , , !! It even gives you to option to pick a later day so that all you packages arrive together and I LOVE THAT I HAVE PRIME!!",5,1
so much easier and faster than having to trapse around the shops. all information on products available so you can compare prices etc. do your research properly and then you don't need to return products. excellent service and reliable delivery's.,5,1
"it'd a great way to do all yor shopping @once. If you're like me (a mother, wife and an employee) than you know the importance of time! Amazon saves me so much time / recommend",5,1
I absolutely love Amazon! I can find things I cant find anywhere else that I need and it always gets delivered promptly! I will be keeping my membership!!!,5,1
"not bad, could be better if Amazon made a way to tell where the purchased goods are shipping from. There should be a american made tab to support american made or even local companies who have goods to purchase. It sucks to fund out that the item you purchased is a cheap Chinese good.",3,-1
What I like best about Amazon shopping is the choices available in one place. Sometimes I still have to dig around a little to find the exact item I want or need for the best price but again; it's in one place. The pandemic has changed their once fast shipping times and the amount of choices available but I still feel it's a convenient way to shop.,5,1
Don't like that it keeps choosing the options Amazon wants [Save and subscribe] and not what I chose..had to do this x times before it let me choose what I wanted.,2,-1
"I think it's an amazing innovative idea that has made our shopping experience so much easier. Only negative is that products are fake, sometimes. Would, also, love that manufacturing country would be disclosed.",4,1
"Every time I open the app and select a product that I want to view, the page loads for a moment before I get an error message with a picture of a dog. The dog is cute, but I can't view my products!",1,-1
"I down load the app and found it's a really great app.it's sad so many peoples seem to have so many issues with it,I guess Im one of the lucky ones,I had problems at first when I first order amazon prime &start to place orders but it was a quick fixed for me and I haven't had anymore problems at all.anytime I need to reach customer service I call them &they send me a text asking am I the one calling I text yes back to them get a call back from them fast within  mintues.so overrall Im lucky.",5,1
I love shopping for my favorite items. although some aren't what they seem. but I have to say that Amazon try it's best to fine a solution whenever there's a problem!,5,1
"Updated and is totally broken, nothing loads at all after  updates in a row. (just now another update presumably to fix the earlier one) Just lots of dog (error) images! Even on the home page! The app is totally useless now!",1,-1
"Constantly losing my orders, deliveries to wrong address - even when using Amazon lockers there are issues. App itself is grain to hide the help feature it seems.",1,-1
I love the app before this latest update. I can't buy literally anything. I press any product and it's says error. Every single product. Will change review once it's fixed!,1,-1
"Recent update says 'press and hold to save' repeatedly on every screen you look at. Once would have been enough but now using your app is so annoying, I'm not bothering!",1,-1
"has been a life saver for hard to find parts, pieces, and tools. elevated costs are expected with the free shipping. Return policy is exceptional. badabingo thanks Amazonia ",5,1
I like the easy and convenience of shopping on Amazon but i dont feel confident with the products that they are of a good standard.,3,1
"sometimes it's hard to find the less expensive version of what you're looking for, but it's worth taking the time, recording things and persisting. Other than that, it's easy for a consumer to use. Oh, make sure you look at return policy for each item you purchase, it can vary depending on the vendor.",4,1
The AMAZON ONLINE SHOPPING APP STORE IS MY #《# FAVORITE ONLINE SHOPPING STORE WEBSITE ANYTIME I NEED  BUY SOMETHING THAT I CAN'T FIND AT ANY LOCAL STORE THAT IS NEAR ME AND  A GOOD DEAL......................... I GO STRAIGHT TO MY TABLET OR iPhone AND SEARCH AND SEARCH UNTIL I FIND WUT I WAS LOOKING  & THEN SOME!!!!!!!! ALSO PRIME IS THE BEST THING EVER  BE ADDED TO AMAZON SHOPPING  BECAUSE OF THIS (# REASON) NO SHIPPING COSTS ARE ADDED ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,1
"generally good, but spend time shopping for items specifically that can be delivered right( prime)away. but when I go to place the order. they change the days of deliveries to  or more days later than original.",2,1
"great app to get thing that you want delivered fast and in great condition, also its easy to return the item if you are unsatisfied with it.",5,1
The problem still exists with purchasing digital music downloads that often only the option to stream is provided in the app. This uses up data and often I don't have connectivity so I use a Sony Walkman digital audio player. To purchase these stream only mps you end up having to use the long winded way and log into your Amazon account via a web browser to make the purchase.,2,-1
"This app just gets worse and worse. They make necessary things like returns and customer service info impossible to find quickly. You can longer cancel certain subscriptions through the app, you have to call customer service, the regular ""orders"" screen no longer loads at all. Things are getting messy when searching for products... Overall it's probably not even worth two stars, but I'll give it a freebie just because I use it instead of the internet on a computer most of the time.",2,-1
"I absolutely love shopping on Amazon, it's easy fast and efficient. On most days my packages arrive days before the actual arrival date. If I could give  stars I would!!",5,1
as more and more products are added to amazon it is becoming the number  for me for all my purchases. keep it up guys but please be clear on deliver times and sellers location it matters. thanks guys,5,1
The app would be great if it had dark mode like most of the other apps. Apart from that it's pretty good. Still the odd glitch sometimes though.,3,1
Very curious about the timing of their delivery truck fleet. Almost like they knew a shutdown was coming. Service has declined tremendously. Undecided if we are going to keep amazon. Streaming service is still very good.,1,-1
"Love it till something goes wrong, lol. Been trying to rectify an issue and very difficult to sort out.",4,-1
Love using this app! I'm able to purchase for myself or purchase for a family member & have it sent to them. Even returning things are simple,5,1
Update: Amazon is still a joke. I ordered an item it's the next day delivery showed up  days later same with another item I just ordered next day delivery here we are  days later on top of that Amazon can't deliver their own packages they have UPS to it and instead of being delivered to my house I'm supposed to go to a store to pick it up when it's supposed to be delivered to my HOME.,1,-1
"This has been a great app for years, for my use. Update issues have been few and quickly solved. Customer service is responsive and checks back with. My only criticism are the people selling on the site. You will need to be careful and read through the product description and seller. Have had issues with them not matching, causing a return. Which was easy. They need to have a better selection for returns. Not all apply. Choose closest. You can leave notes. Over all a good app",4,-1
"Great service, you just need to watch who is delivering your order because Amazon delivery is always faster. Read all of the description and make sure what you're ordering is exactly what you want. Good luck and happy hunting!!",5,1
"Very convenient for online shopping. Has alot of items your looking for and shipping is pretty quick if it's a prime delivery. Becareful reading what comes because some sellers try to hide how much you get and makes the pictures looking like you get more than you do, but most are good. And they are super easy to deal with if the parcel gets lost. And I love how easy it is to track your parcel.",5,1
Cant access my orders page. Never had an issue til now. Always says page cant be displayed or just a blank page. Very frustrating when trying to track my orders. Please fix this!,3,-1
I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling to get the app to work once. After it is closed it stops working. Keep getting UH-OH something went wrong on our end. Please try again ..CS... Please fix,1,-1
Amazon has made shopping during this time of uncertainty. A good experience with timely deliveries.,5,1
"I order because I cannot find certain items elsewhere. Delivery is where I have constant problems. I get notifications that my parcel has arrived but the photo attached is / time NOT my door. it has been delivered to the wrong building, the wrong door, the qrong street or left in my very publicly accessed glass enclosed mail room. Despite my man complaints I still rarely get my parcels the first time I order. being a Prime member means nothing when your  day delivery takes  wk to sort out.",2,-1
obviously the best,5,1
when they get it right its awesome when then get it wrong (we are all human) oh my! but great offers from time to time Interest free in impulse buys  yummy quick delivery with or without prime yep am a fan can't you tell oh and the apps not bad too lol,5,1
"Amazon makes it notoriously difficult to cancel your Prime membership. Turns out I've been paying for prime for months because it didn't cancel. It's okay though, Amazon is good for getting items quickly. Let's not talk about the company's impact on the environment though...",3,-1
"I HATE that it auto selects subscription options. If I want to subscribe to something I want it to be intentional. Otherwise, you SHOULD default to a standard  time purchase. But we all know you want us to accidentally spend more than we intended. Don't even pretend it wasn't your intention.",2,-1
Prime is worth it! order it today at your door tomorrow. So convenient. I don't have to go store to store to find one product. Amazon one stop shop!,4,1
There's alot of things you have that other companies don't. The delivery is always on time for me and I don't have to worry about where my orders are at. Thank you to all the Amazon employees for doing a great job.,5,1
This is a very nice online market. All the good stuff is available here. And the delivery is incomplete. I will say one thing at the end is very good. Apps. Thank you,5,1
I think Amazon is the best place to shop from . I get what I'm needing and I save money on the products and on gas . I live  miles from a big town and gas is high and going higher.,5,1
Pretty easy to find what your looking for. Comparable prices. Quick delivery times.,5,1
"I'v been a subscribed to Amazon for  years now my experience has been a roller coaster ride With-Amazon first you happy and then disappointed. The last bad experience is waiting for my return funds for a pair of shoes. I'd sent these shoes back to the UPS store. I've been tracking them, throughout the returning process, for over a month now and they still haven't received the shoes!!!! When we pay for orders you guys take the money right way: then take like forever with our refund money!",1,-1
I love Amazon They are amazing with fast easy delivery and the prices and items on this app is great  and the Amazon assistants is amazing and very helpful,5,1
"Fix this long term issue The first picture you click on to someones review is in such low and horrible quality. But when I swipe to the next, their camera turns out to not be a potato!! Due to this Amazon feature, I cant correctly view the items I want to purchase. This has been an ongoing issue for years, why?",2,1
"Will yall PLEASE fix your website! I shouldn't have to download the app just to do what I have already been doing on the site. Links on the site are not working properly, and most are unresponsive.",2,-1
"I use Amazon for a lot of my purchases for a myriad of items. Lately I've been having trouble with the app, however. The orders screen continually acts like it's loading with no end result. Can't search recent orders, can't see recent orders. It's useless. The Alexa button is also useless to me-don't need it at all, yet it's prominent on every screen in the app. Sad.",2,-1
"The app was great. Now it is horrible. The my orders tab will not load. Can't see what I have previously ordered or when it's coming in. I have tried closing the app, no more updates, nothing helps",1,-1
"Please take step about your carrier who keep the package at the door, take photo and then steals the package. They dont knock the door. Please investigate this, otherwise I will stop ordering by amazon. Completely frustrating.",1,-1
Shipping to my location is $ or more no matter what I order. It says the app is number  in free shipping but I almost never get free shipping. Honestly Amazon would be the best app ever if they had free shipping all the time.,2,1
Except for recommendation.. i cannot find anyway to search items by category. The apps is difficult to navigate making it useless..,1,-1
"So, during search, I find lots of unrelated stuff that my search terms were meant to eliminate. If I want to modify my terms again I'm forced to reset filters for every term change. My filter choices are pretty consistent but I cannot set a preference for them. Filter choices often omit obvious filters, usb vs fire wire for example, or when a filter is used they don't eliminate the the very thing you filter for. So I am forced to carefully read all descriptions after filter use. TFN",2,-1
"The only problem I have is when you purchase something instead of putting it back on your original payment card,they put it on a Amazon gift card, that not how I paid .I would like my money back on my original payment method, not a gift card,I want spend where I want to pay not only can buy from Amazon only",3,-1
I can't empty items in Shopping basket very annoying that there is no uninstall button for taking out items in shopping basket. I will not be using this app again.,1,-1
I love the app. Especially how many things be available back in stock when I don't have the money to order them when I first put the items in my cart. I like the half price for Amazon prime for people who receive public assistance. And the animated tv shows that comes with Amazon Prime and the use of their music app. All included in one price.,5,1
"An unwanted annoyance (I believe since the last update) has been introduced - Every single item browsed to now displays a popup ""Press and hold to save to specific list."" This might be of use ONCE in a browsing session but NOT for every single item! Please remove this, it's so annoying!",3,-1
I've only just started food shopping with Amazon and its brill and so easy I will do it again also when you go on the shop app it takes  days delivery Not with Amazon same day fantastic I would recommend this to anyone give it a go im so over the moon with this     ️ living it xx,5,1
I would give zero stars if I could. Every time I type something in the search bar a dog pops up with the message UH-OH something went wrong on our end. This has been happening for over a week. What is really going on?,1,-1
The Devs have gone to a lot of trouble to hide the ability to change the selected country store. Short of clearing the cache I have no idea. I like to shop around across the European stores (change country) but I'm off to use the web as I can't find where to change it in this App. It used to be possible.,1,-1
"Unable to see all items saved for later. It's very frustrating, only can see - items",2,-1
"Could really use an update to the UI of the app. Some menus are horrifically slow and look outdated, whether on G or mbps wifi. Otherwise, the best and truly affordable delivery option for Prime customers. Happy Belly brand foods are often half the cost of leading brands! Thank you for providing great no-contact service during the Covid- pandemic. Thank you to the delivery drivers. They are the real heroes!",4,-1
I'm so impressed with Amazon's customer service. Some of their products can be not quite what I expected and smaller at times then I pictured but that's fine the products are usually pretty good and when they are not what I wanted or if there are any issues at all they are ALWAYS fixing any problems. I had some delivery issues the last couple of days and they contacted the post office and tried to get my packages delivered directly to my door and they gave me a  dollar credit just for being,5,1
I'm hating the fact that I can't find out how to change the language to English!!!! It keeps coming up in French!! Absolutely infuriating!,1,-1
"Can't exactly trust the tracking info. (Least not for me) package says out for delivery. From tukwila, check it  minutes later it says it's arrived at the Amazon facility in Kentucky check it a half an hour later and it says it's arrived at the Amazon facility in Connecticut. Tracking used to be great I don't know what happened",3,-1
The app will not allow me to see my order history. Very frustrating when you are trying to track orders. Recent updates seem to have made the app work worse rather than better.,1,-1
It keeps pushing notifications for things in not interested in and there is no way to mark the item as not interested. Its the same item over and over.,1,-1
"What a good app, bad delivery cause sometimes you meet your delivery outside without delivering it to the next neighbour or a neighbour inside the house and good items but when you ordered something be sure you check immediately its been delivered to you cause it will definitely be another thing entirely, happen to order size  football boot came size ,had to return and also order size . amazon brought ., what a crazy workers. I can't return it cause It frustrating moving here and there.",1,-1
Ive had an amazing experience with the app. Customer service is the best and have always solved my issues in time and perfectly. Thank you!,5,1
"Terrible. Deliveries are dropped ANYWHERE on your property and canceling? Hah! Tried to cancel an item that says it will arrive in weeks and yet I'm not allowed to cancel because it's being prepared for ship, when in  weeks? Booooooo",1,-1
"absolutely horrible to cancel a membership. i canceled my prime account once and they automatically renewed my account after i had proof it was canceled. why does amazon keep activating my prime account and charging me for something i am not using? If I can ever get this canceled without renewing the account, i will never buy prime again in my life. horrible customer service and navigation of the site",1,-1
"Sends too many notifications. I get an email from buying, another when it's late or in transit, and another when delivered. It's annoying. Just send a push notification in app and stop filling up my inbox.",4,1
"I can't watch my shows on my Amazon account, I keep getting a notice ,the app is to large. I pay extra for Britt Box and can't use it .if it can't be fixed are we supposed to delete it and go to Walmart?",1,-1
"It's a shame. I did an order on web, received a confirmation on email and since then can't see anything in my account because of ennoying form ""enter billing details"" wich is not working. I can't even go to help chat because this stupid form keeps popping up. Can't upload a document. When I upload file I see ""unexpected error occurred"". I tried pdf and png. No luck. Then I removed file and submitted the form. ""Select a document type above"" error occurred.",1,-1
I order some items on -- and was expected on the next day as they had promised. Well I am stuck waiting until --. Wanted to cancel but must wait until the day after that. Amazon has done so many error with their promises and it's really disgusting. If you promise something to be there at the time given they should keep their promise. Now I find out that the package was put in the UPS so they'll be responsible for whatever happens to the package. They are not truly trustworthy.,1,-1
When i was trying to use the main site due to technical reasons I was redirected to the app which i found to be highly frustrating. I needed to access the main site to manage a subscription I was not happy with and had to uninstall app to view site.,1,-1
Please bring back the heart wish list where you hold in the heart and you can select the list you want to save the product to. Really useful and handy. I'm having to go in separate wish list and save the product to the list I want it to be saved to,4,1
"Amazon Shopping is the perfect thing for me. I can get just about anything I want and at a good price! My device is a Samsung Galaxy A G and I love it! SAMSUNG ROCKS! AMAZON TOO. AMAZON IS THE FASTEST SHIPPING COMPANY I HAVE EVER SEEN! I ORDERED A CD TODAY AND IT WILL BE HERE TOMORROW! That's pretty fast, I think! They are never closed either. GOOD AS IT GETS!!",5,1
More sponsored results and ads than actually what you searched for. Menu options defy reason and you have to scroll through link selling to get to settings. Plus video ads in search results. Recommend for checking orders but no good for browsing and shopping as it's more interested in selling you what you don't want rather than giving ypu what you do.,2,-1
"Real easy shopping for food, the only problem is that the stuff you would want may not be available sometimes. Great app",5,1
"I have currently recived  text messages from Amazon that read ""Due to a problem with your card, we have been unable to charge your payment. If you don't update your card information within  hours, your prime account will be locked permanently"" Plus my payment isn't due until the th.",1,-1
"I get that they may be short drivers , like everyone else. But the fact I have to go looking for EVERY package lately that's supposed to be delivered to my door is ridiculous. I shouldnt have to go play hide and seek every time . My apartment complex isn't even big , they're literally just refusing to bring here . At least put it in the same building!!!",2,-1
"For shopping the app is great, user friendly,easy to send items as gifts etc. But for paying your Credit Card, it sux!! Why make it so complicated? Make a button for paying credit card, we hit the button, make the payment and your done. You need to take some lessons from bank credit card apps.",3,-1
Checking on orders just gives you a blank page. Cant check current or past orders. Totally broken & complete trash.,1,-1
"Getting worse. Or of  orders,  prime and the others not, all  shipped AFTER the expected delivery date, including the prime order. After the second delivery date passed I could request a refund in a week if not delivered by the rd expected delivery date. My orders to this company are dwindling fast. Maybe my shipments got stuck on the space-bound phallic projectile?",1,-1
"Getting very frustrated with the fact that I've been trying for a while now to cancel  prime video channel subscriptions and I can't seem to get anything but a runaround with this. tried numerous ways,followed the sites steps  by ,only to be sent to another dead end.tried many times to get ahold of customer service, to no avail..only option left for me seems to be to just cancel my whole Amazon prime account..such BS !!for such a huge business to screw people around like this is wrong",2,-1
"App doesn't let you view your orders so you can't tell when your orders are going to arrive. Drivers don't care, and deliver items to the wrong house if it takes less effort. Eat a dick amazon.",1,-1
This app is terrible. Never had so much trouble ordering from amazon on my old phone. It is very frustrating.,1,-1
"Reviews are all the way at the bottom of the product usually. An annoyance. Too many suggestions for items to buy. ""Famous"" people I don't know. Ugly clothes suggestions.""Arriving"" still shows on items I've already received. So annoying.",1,-1
"First class shopping app! I have never seen such a important and informative app for all others to follow. All that is responsible for creating the perfect shopping app, Thank you and congratulations!±!",5,1
"Latest version at March ': scrolling is now broken again for wishlist - can't get down the screen in list view. It ""bounces"" rather than moves down, for a long while after opening. Had been a problem which was fixed, but bug is reintroduced at latest update. Sort it, please! Moto G Power/Android ",2,-1
"Great app. Easy to use, navigate, locate or purchase items, return items, etc. It is so easy and fun to use and just ""window shop"" that it is my go to app that I use constantly.",5,1
The order page DOES NOT WORK. Super frustrating!!,1,-1
I actually really like how easy this app is to use. Not to mention the fact that their service is pretty much impeccable. Thank you Amazon for consistent greatness,5,1
I have now had  packages not arrive saying they were delivered with a picture. The app is difficult to navigate and I can't figure out how to contact about it,1,-1
The app went crazy and charged me for my monthly fee over and over and then ran my debit card sometimes  to  times a day and my debit card company charges . each time my card is declined. In December I had over . in decline fees before I canceled my membership. After that the app continued to try to charge my old debit card after I paid . to the card company so that Amazon wouldn't have my card number hoping they couldn't keep charging me. It has been a nightmare.,1,-1
Amazon app is the best because you get to literally buy everything you ever going to need and you get to sell stuff you don't want you can make your own business account to sell stuff and that's all the best parts about Amazon shopping,5,1
"App is bad and getting worse. Order history doesn't load at all which is a huge problem. Load times are crazy slow. The new Alexa button is in the dumbest spot possible. Why anyone would even need an Alexa button is beyond me to begin with. Just awful, it's like they're purposely trashing the app.",1,-1
"I like the app, and would have given it more stars, but it has suddenly stopped showing my wish lists when I want to add things to them. Very annoying.",3,-1
App has been pretty much unusable since the last update. I can't go to my orders at all through the app. I have to use the actual website to see anything.,2,-1
"Amazon is my store for shopping. You can find almost anything. I have learned that if I need or want something to check Amazon first. Amazon's prices are are in line or lower than most other stores. you can purchase your groceries or your high end perfume and it's here. the best thing about Amazon, next to their selection, is their customer service. Top notch! I'm a Prime member and I'm quite happy with Amazon. You do have to watch the private sellers though as some of them are just scalpers.",5,1
Getting very glitchy. Pages wont load. Cant go back. Gets stuck on certain pages. Becoming unuseable.,1,-1
This app get's worse and worse. The more you add the slower it get's. You need to wait seconds after each selection. Seconds is slow for,1,-1
The only thing I don't like is the codes that I have to text together to make a good perches. Thanks Rick!!!!,5,1
"The orders section doesnt display my items. I cannot track, return, or view anything. Very disappointing.",1,-1
Awesome,5,1
"Used to work great but at some point, links from other apps stopped working, such as taking you straight to the gift card redemption section from another app you purchased it through, I now have to dig for the gift card area manually. It would also be nice if it were easier (or even *gasp* auto-recommended!) to enable Amazon Smile in the app, and the fact that it expires after  months is disgraceful. I shouldn't have to research how to enable and maintain Amazon Smile for such a measley .%",1,-1
"Works fine if you don't run into any issues, but support is a joke. No direct way of contacting, a lot of automated responses and nothing solved. Quite shameful for a business of this size",1,-1
This is the best online shopping app ever it's even better if u got Amazon prime. Most of the time you're deliveries are always on time rarely they are late. Every other online shopping app I've used are always late and never on time so I % recommend this.,5,1
Difficult to find what I want. And the tracking doesn't work. Which meant that I had to wait at the door with it open from the time that I was notified that the driver was  stops away until he eventually turned up.,1,-1
Order page doesn't work.... I see many other reviews saying the same thing.. the order page doesn't load and it is so irritating to not be able to track my orders or get to my returns. This last app update was awful!!,1,-1
Used to be good but the new version has too many bugs. Keeps freezing or flickering everything I go to my orders.,1,-1
"Since the most recent update, the app hangs up if I try to add anything to a list. Very frustrating.",1,-1
"Amazon and this app used to be a good and convenient experience, but have started to be drawn elsewhere as the adverts are becoming a persistent annoyance... insurance?..NO..premium?..NO..insurance?..NO..premium?..NO..on every order? .. can't stop thinking that jus is an easy change to make to remember this choice in an app.. Come on Amazon, your better than this!!",1,-1
Please fix whatever the problem is when trying to pull up my past orders! It takes forever to load if never! I have updated my app & it seemed to get worse after the update!,2,-1
Used to be good and reliable. Now they can't deliver most of packages on time. Amazon has to improve their drivers.,1,-1
"Yet, another fail with the update. I don't use Alexa. The short cut is annoying and in the way. And let me remove the Alexa list you put on my lists!!! The huge overhaul you did several months ago sucks. It was great for years until you screwed it up!!",1,-1
Largest company in the world thinks everyone can afford $ phones with enough RAM to support the bloat in app. That's why they sell so many $ phones lol. Need to make an app version for slower phones.,1,-1
"Use this app several times a week to look at items and place orders. Some items are junk and don't even work as stated, others are better than some US products. China makes em we buy em ! Amazon gets them to you in a very reasonable time, which I love! Most prices are very reasonable.",5,1
Good service to serve and deliver your order,5,1
"The app is very slow to switch pages...also the stupid app doesn't work, very annoying!",1,-1
Please bring the old app back. The new app is not working on my android phone. I can't check orders or buy new items. Nothing shows on the search result.,4,1
You would think that with the amount of money amazon make they would have their app fixed by now. It's been  weeks. Still can't see my orders.,1,-1
"It is very difficult to find a way to contact customer service , sometimes the contact seller button is present , other times it is absent. It would be great if there was an option to choose to ship all items in one order , but instead if I make an order I keep receiving boxes for one order over the span of days , this wastes packaging and courriers time, and amazon as a company should be aware of how wasteful this is.",2,-1
"The new grid view for everything is annoying and I can't find a setting to get the items back in list view, I've spoken to multiple ""support"" staff and they have no clue either. Why anyone would want a shopping app to be in a grid format would be beyond me. In stead of easily being able to find what I'm looking for and how much it costs, I'm left scanning right, down , left, down, right....",1,-1
It is a very good app to online shop but I removed a star for lack of options for model trains especially N scale but overall great place to shop.,4,1
"This has become very buggy over the last several months. I've even tried using browers, and have come to the conclusion it's the website, that needs to be debugged. Amazon fix your bloody website, and apps. By refusing to do so you are losing customers by the second.",1,-1
"Used to love this app, however since last week it keeps changing to French. I adjust the language in the web browser or the app but it keeps reverting back. Literally seconds after saving. Or I leave and go back it is in French again. I live in Alberta so it shouldn't be automatic. This is very frustrating and I am ready to delete.",1,-1
how can you beat it ! Time saved looking for products. Most items received in  - days. Awesome !,5,1
"I purchased a moto g  power that was advertised as unlocked,gsm phone. what I received was a locked phone. hours after receiving it,and , trying to set it up with my service,it said it was not set up to connect with service... I could not open to set up APN...It was obviously a locked phone!..I immediately contacted Amazon and asked for a refund and return label,to which Amazon quickly sent.....A few days later I received a email from Amazon, saying I returned a different phone!, and they wou",1,-1
"Cart not working on wifi, on mobile it's fine, on wifi everything works except for the cart, uh oh dogs is all I get, I need to switch to mobile to check out and it's annoying! Happens since upgrading my phone to android .",3,-1
First they increased the membership price. Then they increased the taxesyku pay when checking out. The perk that I loved was getting stuff delivered same day. And now I gotta add . worth of QUALIFYING items. I'd rather go back to Walmart..I spend a lot of money on Amazon and as a valued loyal customer ..I'm being HIGLHY PENALIZED for spending mostly money on Amazon....rich people live in fear of not ever having enough and it shows. People will go back to Walmart in flocks,2,-1
"Very frustrating. I got a message browsing on the website that I could get a $ coupon for shopping in the app. When I go into the app, I cannot find this coupon anywhere when I went to place my order. I both chatted and talked with customer service and they did not seem to understand the issue. I feel like it is a scam and false advertising. I need help.",1,-1
"Amazon is great for delivery and returns, but the app and its UI is absolutely awful. So, so difficult to find what you want, no standardisation for information on products, unhelpful search results. It's a really awful app and mind blowing such a big company can't get the basics right",1,-1
"My packages always arrive on time. Very quick turn around from time order is placed til its received. I can always find exactly what I'm looking for & always at a great price. I also have Prime video & there are alot if great movies to watch. Some are for rent, some you can buy & there are a ton that are free if you have Amazon Prime.",5,1
App even more annoying than the Amazon website: constantly pushing prime and with a confusing interface to try ans get you accidentally buy it. Was promised £ for using this and didn't get it. I'd rather just use the website in browsing.,1,-1
I don't use stores much anymore but for cleaning supplies. Amazon has the best products and guarantee out there on price and quality!,5,1
"Sometimes good sometimes horrible.... and sometimes downright downright disgustingly nasty to clients.... I have reported them to the better business bureau for so many items not recieved, not replaced, and unrefined. I used to  Amazon. No Amazon, no cry!!!!!! Lol ",1,-1
"App is broken. Went and tried to do my grocery shopping on the 'fresh' side of the app and the very last page on the confirmation is just broken. It asks you to select a window for the timeframe of your delivery, but then won't register a selection was made. Obnoxious the VERY last step was the dysfunctional one.",2,-1
Please make the app more user friendly. I changed the date for my subscribe and save subscription and it literally added a second shipment for the month instead of just changing the date for the next shipment. Also there is no total shown for each subscribe and save shipment.,2,-1
"Good app to by almost everything, but very annoying when it comes to deliveries. I have just missed a delivery from a driver that after ringing me unsuccessfully for connections problems, I ran down the stairs, waving at him and shouting, he just passed by me al my front door only  meters away from him and I only recived a message from Amazon saying they will try again, after being all afternoong and evening waiting for my parcel. Very poor comunication with driver, he should have tried again",3,-1
"It's a great app, but with most apps and websites, there is room improvement. For instance, there should be a way to add more than one item to your wishlist at a time, say that I want to bargin hunt for a specific collection of books in different series say Reacher, Cross, Bosch, and others, instead of adding the books individually to the list so that they on one screen at once, users should be able to add all books from a series in a specific format to their wishlist to monitor prices.",4,1
My experience with the app has been terrible . I didn't think Amazon could get any worse but now all the books on my Kindle app have disappeared and Amazon makes it almost impossible to recover them.,1,-1
"Absolute rubbish, works well for a bit then crashes causing everything to become garbled. Seems to reset on its own but only for a short time. Can buy what I want from Ebay, sometimes even cheaper with respectable delivery. Wondering why I'm a prime member. I've tried all the recommended fixes. Even worse since I upgraded my phone.",1,-1
Devs... All I'm asking is to fix the bug issues it's not hard if your an avid android dev. App keeps crashing on every item click. I have to be resorting to the web version which is counter productive.,1,-1
I have been using this app for years. I don't know what has happened lately but I haven't been able to pull up my orders. I was hoping with the last update this would be fixed but it doesn't appear that was the case.,2,-1
I love this app ! But I took one star away because they don't except food stamps for food on Amazon. However if you are serching I bet Amazon has it !! They have everything you can think of.,4,-1
"I dont understand how a HUGE company has the worst shop app and propably overall worst app i have used. Issues i encountered when i first time downloaded the app today: Usa store, english language and euro currency makes the app crash and the app refuses to open anymore. Tested on  devices and only way to open app again is to reinstall it. Swedish store is just a huge mess. I have accepted cookies propably  times, cause app just keeps asking my preference. Loots of errors at random times.",1,-1
Please fix thos- I'm in this app A LOT and there's some inconveniences. . When I'm moving things from one list to another it takes me all the way back to the top of the list that I'm moving things from instead of putting me where I left off I have to scroll past everything that I've already looked at. . When I'm changing things from one list to another the list I transferred things to last should be at the top of all the other list to make it convenient &,3,-1
So many people have told me that Amazon doesn't give their products a good review if a person gets something that is easy to break like something made with glass. I talked to a woman who worked for Amazon and she said she would never buy anything that needs to be careful with because the workers doesn't care how they handle stuff. She said that they just throw stuff around and doesn't care if the stuff breaks or not they throw stuff in the trucks like no respect for the products.,3,-1
"Since update, app looks to time out when clicking into personal info(previous orders) search is slow as hell. App has gone downhill terribly in last  months.",1,-1
"This stupid app has been recently having a hard time loading my past orders . it either gives me an ""Opps something went wrong"" message or wont load past orders at all. I've had to revert to using a website browser. Update this please, it was working fine before. Using this on my Samsung S phone.",1,-1
"Amazon in general is going to the dogs. Ordered several packages between January and now and have been having a very hard time even getting them to send the products. Amazon wants to give $ credits for inconvenience but when the item doesn't show I'm out time and money and the product. Amazon wants to up the prices but can't guarantee a  day delivery when I live  minutes from a hub the said item ""left"". Not the way to do business especially for a company with monthly fees.",1,-1
"First order and they have put my account on hold asking me for card and bank info and all that nonsense, never had this issue with AliExpress asking me for extremely personal information, what a terrible experience from amazon. Just disaapointing",1,-1
I am unsure I will be using Amazon. I had purchased a laptop for $ and realized I bought the wrong one so I cancelled it and never got the money back for refunding it. Instead the sent MY MONEY to some random bank and I have no clue where they sent my hard earned money.,1,-1
"App doesn't work and hasnt for weeks. I keep updating it waiting for a fix but every time you open it and try to check on your orders or god forbid you try to move stuff around in your cart, it just loads for up to  minutes or says ""we're having trouble displaying this page"". Can't even use it enough to complete an order",1,-1
"The app is super slow. It's frustrating just to try to check your orders, it takes a long time. For a company worth billions, it's unacceptable to have this type of problem.",2,-1
"Amazon isn't perfect. I stepped away from it for awhile, but I decided to come back. I qualified for a discounted rate, as I had in the past, but mistakenly re-enrolled at the normal rate. Now, just the thought of having to navigate the sight or call to do that is a monumental task, like I paid to punish myself. To my amazement and awe, Amazon corrected my mistake, for me. Thank you for earning and regaining my confidence. Giving Amazon another chance was no mistake. I'm pleased.",5,1
I'm concerned about an item that keeps popping up on my cart being shipped that I did not order I'm not sure how to stop this from happening again I always cancel it because I get a random notification saying that my card is declined for an order of something I ordered a long time ago and already received how do I cancel this I think maybe it's a product that comes every month how do I cancel this?,2,1
Called at least  times. The first st time they said they would make changes to my account and let me know within a few days when I could try logging back in. No contact made. nd time they said the same thing but added that they willneed to disable my account to make some changes to my account as the security  step verification was not acting normal. No contact. rd time the guy now tells me make another account with same email and # as I can't close it. How secure is that for ID Theft?,1,-1
"I'm not sure how often this app is updated, but it seems to be too often for the amount of persisting bugs. For the last dozen or so versions, any notifications I get from the app don't direct me to what the notification was regarding, it just opens the app on the last thing I was looking at. This wouldn't be such a huge deal if Amazon would regulate the keyword exploitation, I could manually search for things if they weren't  words long and don't fit in the notification.",1,-1
Amazon appears to do NOTHING to stop bots buying all of a hot product. So those of us normal people using the app to try to buy one as a customer get nothing but error messages until the stock is all gone.,1,-1
Is a very good app! Very challenging to get to customer service or to speak to a live person that is the only negative thing about this app,4,1
Absolute trash. Another trash app that locked me out of my own account. Don't ask me to contact customer support. I already did. They hung up on me. Twice.,1,-1
Bad I made one purchase it was fine. Try to make another purchase didn't go so well. Had a difficult time trying to make another order. I'm  years old couldn't remember all those steps I had to go through. Been trying to place another order but I can't get through. Is making me frustrated,1,-1
OK This was the greatest experience. I ordered a whole bunch of items a few days ago and WOW there here today. And a couple were from last night. Thank you so much Amazon. You're the best! As well as all the distributers.,5,1
"Great when it actually works. Everytime there is an update... I have nothing but problems. ""UH OH.. SOMETHING WENT WRONG ON OUR END. GO TO AMAZON HOME."" This error message is especially annoying because a) it is in all caps and b) it does not actually take me to Amazon home. It takes me into a vicious loop of errors and frustration.",3,-1
This app is pretty horrible if I don't have a wifi connection I can even use the app it just shows a cute dog and a Oops something went wrong on our end no matter how good my cell connection is. Needs to be fixed.,2,-1
I love the app but I really hate purilator they don't deliver and the closest one to me is a hot away if I wanted to travel that far too pick up a order if just go to Walmart or some other store please so using purilator,3,-1
The latest version of barcode scanning doesn't work at all!!! Please fix it! Same old issue!,3,-1
DO NOT BOTHER!! They no longer deliver on time care about the customer or service you with a quality product. They have gone from decent to non existent. I've had to return  items in many weeks one of them being almost $ let's just say I'm still waiting I'm just not gonna hold my breath. I pay for prime membership and for what to have them tell me they can't refund me the $ I spent on early delivery. Brick and morder here I come!,1,-1
I use Amazon Fresh every - weeks. The latest update will not allow me to finalize the purchase. The app gets stuck on confirm address and will not move past that screen.,1,-1
I would rate this five stars because I love shopping on Amazon. But the fact that the last time I had prime they kept double charging my account sent their rating for me downhill.,3,-1
Notifications hasn't worked anymore for over a year. Was hoping it would have been fixed as time went on but no. Try doing a Google search but that just gives me directions on how to turn it on. Any fixes?,1,-1
All the reviews for Amazon are very negative and too long. At least for me Amazon has not crashed ever and it works very well for shopping inside and outside the US.,5,1
Won't tell you when your Amazon is going to renew and isnt consistent on which day it takes out. Amazon prime is a rip off. Tried to use it to watch movies and wouldn't even load movies.,1,-1
"Been having problems for a while searching products very slow and often end up with the ""whoops we have a problem message"". Have reloaded and not made much difference very frustrating",2,-1
Bad experience,1,-1
It's so frustrating that one of my order is out of stock... And they send me a message that they will return my mo ey after weeks...and it's been  month now but still theres no money return in my ATM.. I called theme again and they said it's already return my money but still there's no money to be return...Not like other stores that if some of your order not available its automatically they refund your money.. They put on your wallet in the store... I don't recommend this app....,1,-1
Very fast delivery time from placing my order of  remote controls for Panasonic products. Excellent professional service. well done !,5,1
Good app easy to use lots of deals to find on there. Only problem is every time I open the app it gives me a white screen instead of opening straight away. So I have to exit and open again. I will try and reinstall the app.,5,1
The customer service is phenomenal!!! I order things on here because its cheaper than driving somewhere since I live out in the country. I ordered the wrong vaccuum bags and it was going to cost just as much to send them back as what they cost.... I contacted them to see if there was another option and the rep just refunded me and thanked me for being a member! I am going to order new bags that FIT and do plenty more shopping with them. Thank you Amazon for lookin out! I didnt expect that,5,1
"It is impossible to contact Amazon if you have hearing problems and can't use the phone. I have shopped regularly but changing to a new device I cannot log in to my account. I am sent in a never-ending circle of login, verification, so called approval and back to login, verification etc. After  days of this I am fed up. The so called email support came back saying nobody monitored it and to ring. I was able to buy what I wanted from my old device but that might be my last purchase.",1,-1
"I LOVE AMAZON!! So many products, really good prices, and customer service is always helpful if you ever have an issue!",5,1
Cannot find AmazonSmile Settings. Works ok for shopping despite being kinda slow. Not a big advantage over the web browser.,3,-1
"This amazon app keeps switching to spanish. I do not know spanish so, unable to change it back to English. What a PAIN. i have to delete i guess.",3,-1
Not as great as i though this thing sucks bigtime. I see the dog so often. I dont even try to order from amazon anymore. I doubt they care either. Im considering canceling all my subscriptions and going elsewhere. Its several months since i wrote my origional reviee and i havent seen any change at all. It works ok on my kindle but the app mostly doesnt work at all on my phone. Doesnt look like they care either.,1,-1
"Stop being late on deliveries you promise will ship on certain dates, and in many cases, overnight! My current late order is already  days late as of this post. This happens way too often for a brand of your caliber. Edit: This shipment never arrived, but more than a week after this review I got a notification saying it was left at a UPS Center to be picked up instead of being delivered to my house as promised.",3,-1
Fix the your orders page. This is annoying I can't even return something cause I can't see my orders or when they will be delivered. Soo annoying,1,-1
"I have cancelled my prime membership long back. But I dont noticed later that I was being charged for it for months. When I raised the complaint, it was reimbursed. Now after months Iam facing the same issue. I just noticed on my card statement that prime membership is being charged. But it shows that I dont have a prime membership on the app. The customer care guy says its auto renewed. This was not done by me, which means its been automatically done from amazon's side.",1,-1
Clearly no QA done on current gen phones. Order history hasn't worked on my Pixel  in weeks. No obvious mechanism in the app for bug reporting.,1,-1
"Racist settings. Lately everytime i use the site, my language settings are switched spanish. I assume because my name is spanish they assume i speak & prefer spanish. I don't and that is racist. I've tried manually setting my language settings to English & it still defaults to Spanish the next time I use the site/app. This is incredibly annoying and offensive.",2,-1
Been using the app for years no issues. After selecting language and currency the app closes and won't open again. It's a android  issue needs fixing! App still works perfectly on my older android  phone,1,-1
"The reason that l am rating it  stars is because l have order a package three times. First time it came and l was happy but then their was a a problem with it, Second time l refunded it then bought it again. Didn't come. Third time I bought the same thing happened. Like where the hell is package.",2,-1
"Happy with App, virtually never have any issues using & thanks to signing up to Prime, can get most thing next day & sooner if in certain post code areas. Images of products have, for me, been accurate, reviews helpful & only ever had one damaged product whixmch was replaced without any fuss. Hardest aspect is the form of contacting Amazon CS if there has been a delivery issue, for me, is too long winded, a direct chat line would suffice",5,1
I'll never order another thing from Amazon again. I created a registry so this company could order me stuff through there. My coffee table lights that I got I can't get a hold of anybody to get any information on how lights go on there. I put a futon and mattress in my registry and somehow only the mattress gets ordered. An Amazon customer service is no help whatsoever. Never again eBay or Walmart no Amazon but they're more expensive you can't really get a hold of the sellers like you can w/ebay,1,-1
Dont use Amazon SG for orders sold and supplied from Amazon US. Sure they may offer free delivery but Amazon SG cant even contact Amazon Fulfilment centre to check on orders status. Custom service are polite but have stated .... we cant contact amazon US. Im unable to as well. Only suggest try cancel and reorder again. Despite shipment overdue already (Now a higher price as well).,1,-1
No longer works. Every time I load it i get uh oh something went wrong. Tried reinstalling. Clearing data. Still same results. Update //. Still broken.    - still same error,1,-1
Usually a great experience shopping on Amazon. I've had a few mix ups but they've always made it right and that's what matters.,5,1
The app sucks if your searching for a gift cause the app now only lets you choose certain things and you need to know what you want or else it won't pop up...before they let you choose from a list like new tech...now it shows sonly stuff that I don't want or need because they think it is what I want...let me decide what I want not you,1,-1
Why did the app change my language? I can't spend money if I can't read it! I went to settings and put the US 🇺🇸 for English. It shows the right flag but it's the wrong language!,1,-1
"Unbelievably Poor Customer Service... With support staff as apathetic as Firose, who just ignored numerous questions and tried to end the conversation without solving the issue, you can't help but wonder what they're paying their customer support team to do. The customer support team is the worst part of using this app.",1,-1
Amazon is always my first go to app for any online purchase they always seem to have the best products plus the best product reviews I love the prime shipping option and quick delivery as well plus I've never had a problem returning anything either,5,1
"This app is f worthless. I'm signed in on app and website and shopping list and cart does not match. Each time I need to fix my address with is remaining on useless app without any option to switch from website to application. It terms of user experience, searching and filtering products it's worst app ever used. I cannot understand how Amazon is leader on global market. If support can help me solving at least how to find list save in browser on this damn app...",1,-1
Almost half the products in my search results are ads. This is incredibly inconvenient when I'm only looking for a specific brand product. I'm complaining to Amazon everywhere until something is done about this. It's ridiculous.,1,-1
"Next day delivery is NEVER next day. It's always  or  days. It's gets so frustrating when it says next day delivery & that's why you order that certain product, then when it comes time they always email saying it's a day out or sorry we're running behind. I'm honestly going to cancel my Amazon subscription that I've had since . It's a waste of money.",1,-1
So I ordered a phone case and used the advertised  day shipping. The case was sent to my old address that I have no access to (funny since I triple checked my address book And mad sure it sent to the new one) and when I called customer service and explained what had happened they told me that it was in the final sorting phase and could not be cancelled. Their suggestion was for me to be a porch pirate and intercept the order to return it.  THAT'S ILLEGAL and  I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE HOUSE.,1,-1
"Please fix this app. I keep having one issue after another. *First issue: If you need to type a message or comment in the app (ie: leaving reviews, texting for help etc. ), the keyboard pops up and covers the dialog box so you can't see what you're typing. *Second issue: The orders page will not load. Sometimes I can get it after hitting back, but most the time it's just a blank page. I can't check on shipping status, returns etc. This is an important feature and needs corrected please.",2,-1
"It is the worst, it doesn't even want to open. The app doesn't work. It is giving me problems,it always closes up when i try to open it.",1,-1
"Broken search and filters for Egypt app. No search history, and when I apply a filter it messes all the results and shows me unrelated products to what I was searching... Also, the filters work with some weird criteria... I can't set a limit to the price.. I can't choose the brand in some items.. Can't choose relevant criteria to the product (e.g. screen size, storage and RAM for electronics, size and color for cloths and foot wear.. etc.).. Please fix all that.. It was available on souq app.",2,-1
"What is the point of this app? I try by a gift card, I get blocked. Customer service number gets blocked from my device, and the app just sends me round in circles. Really, why did you make the app? Just say your products are limited to people in certain countries. There isn't even a way to get help once your account is locked. What a useless app. Your customer service is pathetic.",1,-1
I totally love the Amazon prime members app even more than eBay when ordering any types of products the Amazon app allows you to make a purchase order and get the product same day delivery and you can choose any delivery time and date on the app as long as you choose your delivery before pm you will get your order anytime up until pm or even pm at night  i totally love ordering products on this Amazon app knowing that I can get same day delivery and my delivery always come on time ️️️️,5,1
Great plat form application. Easy to use and helpful after sale customer service if you bought something that not match the provider description.,4,-1
"This app is absolutely ridiculous, just got a brand new phone and the app is constantly crashing while trying to login to my account. Out of + apps, this is the only one I'm having issues with. Think I'm finally going to get in after the MFA only to get kicked back to the create an account or login screen.",1,-1
"Amazon used to be a fair priced site to shop on but the prices on certain items I just bought a year ago have tripled in price. Plus prime membership has gone up as well. If I go to Walmart, I pay a lot less on things like laundry detergent, shampoo and body wash. Delivery is usually on time but sometimes it can take up to a week to get prime qualified deliveries. It's still so convenient to get things delivered to my front door, though.",3,-1
"We need a ""SAVE FOR LATER"" option when shopping for groceries. I don't have Alexa.. so saving to, and finding things, in the Alexa list is not that easy. If there was a SAVE FOR LATER (like with the regular cart), items could be found much easier. Please add this option.",3,-1
More organized than the website on PC. Very easy to use and streamlined app,5,1
"Oops error on our end. Amazon tech support was no help. Forum post explains this is due to ad blocking, which I had recently enabled on my router. Turn off adblock, or search SNB forums for allow list. Ridiculous that prime members pay over $ a year for an app that will not work unless they can push ads.",2,-1
While i was browsing Amazon on browser i received a pop saying if i use the app I'll get $. I clicked on it and used the app but i don't see that credited to my account. The Amazon helpline transferred the call to App Star team he has no knowledge of it rather than reading promo description and he hung up on me when I requested info on what happened to my $. Rude.,1,-1
"Everything is overpriced and I am getting scammed way more often now. Combine that with the upcoming price increase. I'm sorry but there is not enough protection for the cost. At this pointI'm basically paying Amazon to take advantage of me. PS, Google you need to allow us to upload screen shots of our problems with apps when we give ratings. I have transcripts of walking the Amazon rep through this latest scam. I had to copy and paste the bad reviews in to the chat as well as ask for manager.",1,-1
Reason for  stars is DON'T OFFER SAME DAY DELIVERY IF ODERED IN  HOURS IF YOUR NOT GOING TO JOLD UP TO IT. AND PACKAGING I DON'T NEED A A CARDBOARD ENVELOPE FOR A RING COMMON ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS. For a billion dollar company if this stuff can't be sorted then sell it to someone who can. Also delivery is very inaccurate too.,2,-1
"When I'm in the middle of a search, and switch to another app for a moment, when I return to amazon it resets to home page - forcing me to start the search over. :/ But the worst thing is that in  I still can't exclude search terms!! This is killing me, often I just give up on amazon and go elsewhere, cause there's no way to filter unwanted search results. Can't believe this is still an issue.",2,-1
"I updated the app a couple of weeks ago not knowing the layout had changed. Got used to it quickly, but I have one issue. When I go to my orders, I cannot see what was recently ordered most of the time. I updated the app a few minutes ago thinking that issue had been resolved, but it hasn't. I need to be able to see my recent orders every single time, but most of the time I can't. As for the new layout, doesn't really make anything better............",3,-1
"I held off on installing this app for so long. Finally did so, great regret. It seems to have somehow corrupted my Amazon account. Perhaps there is some kind of background collaboration with an independent company Amazon Pay. Whatever. Don't do it. I am unstalling and using other websites for my online business.",1,-1
"Not sure what's happening at Amazon, but they FAILED to deliver my last THREE consecutive packages I've ordered. Used to be real good. Now they are worse than USPS. I'm ordering from other websites now. Considering Amazon isn't prime anymore, or even delivering packages at this point. I'll wait the extra time to ship from another website. A holes.",1,-1
I absolutely love this app you can find so many awesome things you can buy on Amazon and the app makes it so much easier than having to go to the website itself!!!,5,1
"I've ordered plenty of items from Amazon for my  the Birthday last year and loved the service they texted me and let me know when my merchandise would arrive and was on time every time and they would text me and let me know with a picture that it was delivered and were it was left just in case I wasn't home, only took a few days to receive it and couldn't ask for nothing better and wouldn't change them for the world, ordered from someone else before them and took a month to receive. I'll BONW",5,1
"Overall, the app had been pretty good. Lately it has not been allowing me to access my orders without making several attempts. Oftentimes when searching, it comes up with an error and sends me back home. I'm not sure what has happened, but I would most definitely like it to be fixed!",3,-1
"You guys disappointed me today. I ordered two items on Amazon. They were supposed to be delivered today, the driver left a message saying Item was delivered to a resident. He couldn't give that resident identification. The driver stole the items himself. I can't believe that. I lost my money. I do not even have a customer service number to call them. I looked for a number on the Amazon page call. I can't find a number. This is a total robbery.",1,-1
"I guess it's ok. Still get stupid call's from people saying they is calling from Amazon and a purchase was taking out in my name a order from Apple Pods and a Apple Phone for about . Dollars. I never ordered Apple products in my life. Somebody probably using my identity, I would not be surprised.",4,1
"I have been on and off with Amazon for some time, but no matter what Amazon is great. I am connected with Prime so my children enjoy the freedom to watch there shows and with Amazon Music I have experienced different ways and blessed additions to my music applications. Thanks for an overall blessed experience.",5,1
Bad experience everytime app so laggy,1,-1
"bringing up the ORDER list causes the app to crash. Something was changed on Amazon's end as it displays the ""uh-oh something went wrong on our end"" message. hoping for a quick solution.",3,-1
I have two authentication apps but Amazon still send me an OTP via SMS for two factor authentication. Many screens in the option menu open a WebView with the regular Amazon website visualised inside the app (obviously doesn't fit so the experience is horrible). It's ultra slow.,2,-1
"Complicated menu, no free shipping but for orders over $, won't show how much tax and shipping costs are added to my purchases. Walmart is better, except you have more products. Also, a lot of your clothing is cheap made.",2,-1
"The app has been pissing me off lately. Language switched to French and there's no option to change it back to English. Went on the website to change it, but does not reflect on the app.",2,-1
"absolutely love Amazon. They are exactly what they say they are. if you are not satisfied with product with a qualified time frame you can return no question asked. returns are as easy as ordering. customer service is just like ordering an returning very simple,fast and easy,but also patient very friendly,and patient. Love Amazon--A-CLAUSE.",5,1
"I have reloaded this app several times because an error keeps showing on their pages for descriptions of products. I reload and it keeps happening. Please fix this issue, thanks.",1,-1
Nice app,5,1
"I stream everyday on Amazon Prime with a firestick. This week the app updated and the new platform sucks. Previews autoplay when you light on the show, and you can't look up actors and their IMDB information on most shows. These are my two biggest pet peeves on other platforms, and I'm sad to see that Amazon, which was the cream-of-the-crop in streaming, now bow to that lower standard. I can't even undo the update, according to the customer service person.",2,-1
"Since I can't find any feedback option in the app (what a surprise, worlds shittest company won't accept feedback), I'll put it here. What is the point of storing payment methods when if you want to switch between them you have to verify the whole card number AGAIN? Isn't the point of a password and security on your account to protect against the kind of abuse you're attempting to prevent by making customers confirm their card number? Terrible user experience = amazon",1,-1
Been using prime for years. Issues started with being unable to critique sponsored items I bought. If it's anything under  stars you get banned from reviewing and CS never responds to emails. Now there's an irritating alexa bubble on my screen when using the app. No way to remove it at this time. Might be getting time to move on from Amazon.,2,-1
"What irritates me is Amazon is totally spying on me, I work at Walmart and my work phone is my product scanner for stocking products, every item that have scanned shows up as recommendations for Amazon purchase. Other than that I'm content with the app.",2,-1
This thing is pretty useless for doing anything with orders or account. Pops the keyboard over the text field so you have to type blind Also Amazon has pretty much become a clearing house for Chinese garbage on par with all those dodgy market places. Low quality mislabeled items,1,-1
"World's worst app. All it does is crash. I counted. Just to check the status of an order. It collapsed  times. Seriously, if you think an app that doesn't work is worthy of . star average, go for it, but it would seem that a company that earns  billion dollars a year in net profits a year could make a passable app. Apparently not.",1,-1
"I've ordered from the app several times. The first time was ok. There after has been terrible! I have specific instructions on my account, ""drop off at front door,"" because I don't order unless I'm home. Several time the packages were left anywhere, I live in an apartment complex, not good. The app is buggy and extremely slow and I receive all types of error messages. Will most likely delete the app. Now I'm having issues trying to delete my account!",1,-1
Functional. Recommendations based on other purchases/products I've viewed are often not really useful. Would love to see the feature from the web added where you can check off specific items to check out from your cart at a time.,4,1
"Two factor authentication just don't work. OTP for SMS was not received at all. No numbers were blocked on my phone, and I used to be able to receive OTP from Amazon before Feb this year. Now it doesn't work. Is there a glitch or something? It doesn't work on app as well as all Amazon websites.",1,-1
"This app works to buy stuff, but will not allow for Hub Locker use/package recovery. You need to cancel the order because you cannot retrieve the item(s) from the damn locker. Annoying and causes a delay when you're paying g for the quicker delivery. It would be great if it worked, or even better, the Amazon Delivery drivers would use secure boxes or take the time to place packages between doors or for that matter, treat packages like it was something they bought! DISAPPOINTED",2,-1
"Completely useless. Used to be a great app but now it crashes constantly. I have had great luck with Amazon as a company but when every single page fails to load, the app can't even be called functional. Filtering products used to work but now it just removes % of items.",1,-1
"This app is just a web view around their website. It's ugly and bloated with options (just like the website). Finding anything is a pain. Oh, and push notifications for authorization, live chat, requesting a call - they all don't work. Edit: still same issues.",1,-1
Fix the app. It's not letting me go down my list or if I have stuff saved for later it doesn't load. I enjoy shopping on it but just don't need problems to the point I won't shop on Amazon. Prices did go up and estimated tax sucks. If something gets messed up before arriving to the people place and you requested a refund but have to wait for it to be processed and then you will give the refund back. How about let the person know when you get it processed so they know when they get money back.,1,-1
"What is old is new again. I made this review below last year, then they fixed it, and then they made it unusable again. Noting like hiding all your departments that were visible before and moving the menu to where it shouldn't be. Love having to search for where groceries went. The only thing I shop on the Amazon app for is local delivery the fact that I'm being shoved into some sort of cluttered nightmare mess of a UI just to find what I always shop for is a stupid decision Amazon's part.",1,-1
"Convenient for the most part. Contacting sellers for replacements/returns/missing parts could be easier. My biggest issue is my reviews being denied constantly even though I haven't broken any rules. And then it won't tell me what specifically was ""rule breaking"" about my reviews. I rely on reviews to help decide if an item is worth buying as do a lot of people. Makes me wonder how many others have been denied, and how many purchases I've avoided/made for a lack of honest and clear reviews. FIX",3,-1
"What happened? Your screen up tracking orders. It used to with well but now is wildly inaccurate. First, I have several orders that have been delivered that still show as in progress on the app. Second, the detailed tracking progress is gone. Please undo whatever you did.",1,-1
"I am trying to enter to my new downloaded app and all is going well but it stop in a window that says to check my email notifications, in the e mail notification it says that someone is attemting to sign in.. I got my all info correct in the app and in my email it says it is wrong...WTH is going on. The app is garbage stealing precious data space and good for nothing. I will remove it. I keep the web version only of the amazon.",1,-1
"This whole app needs to be updated. Amazon is one of the biggest companies in the world and this app functions like it is over  years old. Don't get me wrong it does work, but needs to be totally updated to a more modern, fast and fluid build. Will edit review when that happens.",1,-1
Just the worse app and customer service help EVER No more I always order here at times if I can't get items the normal way ASAP but always a forever technical issue with where my item have Been delivered or not or that you can't really contact someone that can give more details to what happen just expected to hold out a lifetime of a waiting game,1,-1
"This app is awful. Stop moving everything every time you update, it's incredibly frustrating. Also, fix your wish lists. I try to scroll through and it glitches, getting stuck in one spot and bouncing every time I try to scroll down. Worst app ever. Maybe use some of your amazon billions to actually produce a decent app.",1,-1
"This app is a bloatware. Annoying and useless. It takes control of your Amazon email and other content and needlessly activates itself and tries to sell you stuff every time you try to check the status of an order etc. I don't know no why T-Mobile put this and other un-installable bloatware on the phone I purchased paying full retail price. I wanted to return the phone back, they asked me to pay % I don't feel like I own my phone anymore. I am being constantly redirected to useless content.",1,-1
It barely works and gives you an error screen about every other time you select something. It also does this while you are trying to check out. It has been bad since probably October  and nothing has been done about it.,2,-1
Prime member SHOULD NOT be forced  look at ADS! That's part of membership! Raising prices again! App is  & BRIGHT! No Dark or Night Option. I also shouldn't be presented w/ video AD after spending $+! I mean GD I'm using your app a store app! Not a fan of the overhaul of menus & buttons either. So tired of merchants denying warranty service & Amazon let's them continue to sell ...,2,-1
"Stop constantly altering the app. Things that use to be in plain view, on the navi list, now have to be hunted for, in the various navi lists. And not to do with the app, but with the company services... What's with CONSTANTLY sending me messages about the super amazon services, that *gasp* I am not taking advantage of. But... There is a service we once got, but no longer have. The free delivery on orders of $^, from Whole Foods. Nope! Now EVERY order is $., no matter cost. Safeway it is!",2,-1
"Needs to allow more communication with Amazon. A carry-on luggage I ordered was delayed in shipment. They issued a refund - which I did not want or ask for - rather than send a replacement. When I went to order a replacement, the price had gone up nearly $ in those few days!! I tried to leave a review but since it was seller feedback they wouldn't let me. I tried to leave seller feedback but they wouldn't let me since I never received the item. Then they sent me a link to their ""help"" page.",1,-1
"The app has not been working for the past month or so. It takes many tries to load the purchase history page, sometimes I just give up and stop looking. The app has been crashing a fair amount and is very slow to load in general.",2,-1
"Getting worse. Search for 'carlin peas' and I get every type of pea. Search results say  items, but select 'price: low to high' and it now says  items. Where did the extra  items come from? And if you don't have Prime, delivery costs are rediculous. Also, I can't find any way of giving feedback through the app.",1,-1
On the order I just made there was no size mentioned on the final tally. I have also not received refund for three products that I purchased two of which I did not order and another that I'm owed $.  Amazon never return the money! You also blocked me from calling customer service I don't believe that is fair trade. Thank you for your consideration I could really use my money back!,1,-1
Why so slow now opening orders and lists front the home page? It used to be fast. It just lags alot now. Also slow adding some items to the cart. I just got a new phone and it's still slow as Christmas. It's just kind of annoying,4,-1
A feature I would love to see included is the ability to rate whoever delivered our products. I've had many different companies and small named companies deliver to my home and I think it would be great motivation if they were able to receive feedback for it. Some who deliver are very amazing and do a wonderful job and I would love for them to receive the recognition for it. I would hope it would also boost moral amongst workers. Knowing you're appropriated can go a long way! Thank you.,5,1
"This app has major issues! For one, once signed in, I can't get to my profile or menu list to ever get the sign out option. It just turns and never renders the options. This is on a Lenovo tablet. I agree with others that recommend using the web instead of this app!",1,-1
"Since the last update, the Wish list is now unusable. It refuses to scroll properly - just judders and jumps about. This is on a high end Android  phone. Come on Amazon, sort this out please. The app is unusable in this state.",2,-1
"Amazon is usually a great shopping app. Off late (Feb Mar ) the app seems to be faltering, correct passwords rejected and just not doing it.  Hoping it improved soon. To return to it's usual reliability.",3,-1
"The app is so-so, a little glitchy at times, and half of the time the information is inaccurate. The delivery service is utter garbage, and more often than not, the product packaging (not delivery pakaging) is damaged in some way, ie: already opened. I use Amazon far less than I used to, it's mostly overpriced cheaply made garbage anyway. I can get the exact same product(s), or better, at the shops, which is what I will get back to doing once I close my account. Amazon is really not worth it.",1,-1
"It literally crashes every  minutes. Honestly pointless at this point to download it, or open it to shop cause all its gunna do is crash before I actually finish what I'm shopping for. And I'm not trying to spend all day online every  minutes reopening the app just so I can find what I need. I really hope it gets fixed. Because I quite enjoyed amazon.",1,-1
"I have received  empty packages from Amazon totaling over $. They forget to seal the bag before shipping products, and won't let me get my money back... They claim ""you must return the product for a refund"" but I never got the product, so how could I even return it? I'm just a broke college student trying to buy things I need for class, good to know Amazon doesn't care about people like me ",1,-1
"Keeps begging for reviews on things it won't let me review Old:The latest updates are not an improvement. I wonder how many of the bugs are on purpose just to beat customers down until they randomly buy things in the (vain) hope that they'll get what they want. The new app logo sucks. Old: Shopping works (kinda), but... If I'm doing a review it should at least not randomly erase everything I've laboriously typed. ALL my efforts are gone. ! Bad developers!No biscuit.",1,-1
"Cannot open/view details of any product. The app would not update, had to uninstall and reinstall again but it still doesnt work - just says 'an error has occurred when trying to process your request' whenever I click on any product. Useless.",1,-1
"Guys be careful this amazon is quite clever in doing the ""free trial"" and if you don't know anything about it after a couple of days they'll take your money for subscriptions. My mistake is that I did not paid attention for that because I didn't know that it's quite a trick that after the subscriptions for free trial they'll automatically take it from you card. So disappointed",1,-1
This app used to work well with easy menus etc but now it doesn't like to load properly. Going through your saved for later from the cart never loads beyond the first few items and there's no option to load the entire list nor see it. Also there use to be an option while returning an item or needing customer support to have them call you when someone became available. It's getting worse by the update and less user friendly.,2,-1
These people have all these rules in place that don't work. I had about  different cards on file but only one said default. Now to my understanding that's where they automatically take money from. I pay for Prime annually because I use it all year long. But this year they decided I'm gonna charge all your cards repeatedly until I get my funds. Now customer service was trying to tell me it does that but who's gonna pay for all  overdraft fees @ $/ea?,1,-1
It is convenient to have an app that can deliver items to you. But not when they literally close your account because you got  separate $ gift cards so then you can never access your account again. This company is horrible. I got  gift cards in one day and they decided to just steal my money and never let me access my account again.,1,-1

"As you consumer I appreciate, Amazon very much. Because basically, in the past it has always had what I was looking for. The one thing that led me away from Amazon, was because it used to have PayPal. Which it no longer has so I turn to eBay with the confidence, of using PayPal. Which is the benefit in itself when you run into problems with merchandisers you can turn the PayPal to help you out which they have. So that is the reason that Amazon and I are not always on the same page thank you, I m",4,1
"Still does not work properly with Android  and opening up lockers. So Amazon decided to change the hub near our house and the new hub does not have the kiosk entry pad. So I'm told to use their app to open up this new locker hub. Problem is the app does not work with Android  and it crashes. So I'm told to update the app and I noticed that it's been updated  days ago and I'm trying to open up the locker today. I know the Android  update has busted a lot, thanks Google",2,-1
"Late deliveries and recently none at all! Nothing arrives when it says it will, or it gets pushed back two days after being out for delivery for  hours. I've had  orders in the passed week just never show up. I was refunded but that doesn't make up for the huge inconvenience for the items I needed in the time frame amazon gave that never arrived. I'll be looking for another retailer for my go-to. Cannot depend on Amazon anymore :( rip",1,-1
"The issues with this app are numerous and ridiculous. And customer service treats you like you've never used a smartphone or computer asking ""did you turn it off and back on?"" Not much point in giving you all the permissions to be in my phone if I can't access the pickup locker. Pathetic",1,-1
"If you do not have Prime, this app is basically an agressive ad for it. When I began using this app it was a great way to find a variety of quality items you could get shipped. Now, the selection changes constantly and what you want is mixed in with a plethora of awful off-brand items at a - or - ratio. It's so bad I try not to purchase here for anything but books and some groceries. Even then, the subscribe feature constantly tells me my items are out of stock.",1,-1
"The app kicked back to a backup payment when I selected payment plan on my Prime Visa. I was then charged the FULL $, & nobody would help me. Even with the BBB involved.

"Terrible Delivery Service. Drivers often lie about them trying to deliver and don't even show up. Unable to follow instructions in their own ""instruction box"" where it tells them what to do.

Latest episode included seeing the time estimate jump even before the delivery attempt was made. After two days and Amazon calling  times cancelled service.",1,-1
"This app is horrendous. Can't buy an item with gift card money because the shipping is automatically set to the highest price, meaning I can't get past the first screen til I add a payment method. Terrible configuration, terrible customer support. It's like you talk to a bot and then get forwarded to a human who talks like a bot, and doesn't help. My encounter ended in the chat ending and my problem remaining unsolved. For a multi billion dollar company, this is a disgrace.",1,-1
"Amazon isn't what it used to be. The annual fee is getting higher. Shipping times are more wrong than correct and my biggest issue is that Amazon will let ANYONE sell. So scam companies and counterfeit items are constantly being sold. Some items have ""fake"" comments. Example: someone is selling a hammer and it's got . star reviews but when you go to the comments the reviews are for a purse instead? Idk how they do that but that's also another problem.",1,-1
"FIX THE APP ASAP....Last update to the app is horrible. Used this app every day for years with no issue, now since the update the app keeps closing, is unresponsive, and wont go past the homepage before it becomes unresponsive. I should not have to go on my laptop every time I shop Amazon. You raised the price of prime and now your app doesn't work. What's up with that?",1,-1
"Bad customer support, rarely accurate delivery times. I get items from Walmart and Best buy delivered faster to my house free of subscription costs than I do from prime with a fee. I favored prime heavy in the past but I am so tired of inaccurate  day delivery advertising which I expect to take , but now it's  days for items. They always say well it is  day shipping once we finally ship it, they don't mention they might take  it  other days for someone to prep  item, not peak season.",1,-1
"I shop on Amazon pretty often, and the app is pretty user-friendly. Although one issue as of late, I can't pick up packages from Bluetooth hub locations on the android version of this app, but I tried on my iPhone, which worked perfectly fine. It keeps giving me an error, so that needs to be fixed.",4,-1
Love a platform that can't properly account for their own mistakes and would rather pass the buck and redirect you to the seller. Getting to the point where I only shop here if I ABSOLUTELY need something that I can't find anywhere else. Amazon itself is hot garbage.,1,-1
"It's always worked fine. Now, it buffers and needs to be closed and reloaded numerous times before it works. Has trouble loading and playing videos as well no matter if it's on WiFi or phone data. The entire app is garbage now.",1,-1
"Amazon, why are you forcing Portrait when grocery shopping? It's awful when using a tablet. Please let me shop how I prefer. It's an unnatural way to hold a tablet. I don't know anyone who holds a tablet in portrait, everyone I've seen holds them landscape. It's just not necessary on a tablet, no good reason to force us. I've not bought anything because of this, check my account and see this. It's that uncomfortable.",2,-1
Why have you got rid of the ability to view all my open orders. Why would you even think that was a good idea. It's also impossible to get decent search results for authors sorted by publication date. Looks like o might have to do my shopping what where as the app is unusable for actuall shopping.,1,-1
"Not sure if it's just me, but whenever I'm at my relative's home the app keeps stopping. Whether I'm connected to network or wi-fi. It doesn't happen anywhere else. No other app does this and no one else in the household has this problem. App does not need an update. I have tried many ways to troubleshoot the issue and no luck yet. I spent a lot of time at this home. Very frustrating.",3,-1
*!* DONT SHOP WITH AMAZON *!* i wouldnt recommend amazon if using it were the dif between life or death. absolutely horrible experience and with a large order not some small petty thing. delivered to wrong address after screwing up and repeatedly charging me till it froze my bank account.  days later still delaying any sort of fix no matter which option i go with. wasted  days so far and almost $ on items marked for undeliverable and returned to seller through the carrier and i have nothing but anger and a closed bank account with empty wallet to show for it.,1,-1
Amazon has everything and anything you can think of ..or can't think of lol.. I love looking through stuff.. learning about all the awesome new stuff out there.. and they keep you up to date with your delivery and when it should arrive. I have never had an issue :),5,1
"Why would they think it's a good idea to remove a basic ""shop by department"" feature? I want to be able to drill down, I don't know offhand... user experience on app leaves you frustrated and I'll just use the desktop instead. Poor design choice, hope they roll it back in next update",2,-1
Won't work for Amazon lockers. Went to pick up and the app required an update. Now big will not allow bluetooth pick up. Very poor. No point in online shopping if I cannot get the product. It will now have to be timed out for collection and returned.,1,-1
"What I love about Amazon is no matter what you need, big or small you can find it. The products I've ordered are all great quality. Shipping & packaging is excellent. The app is user-friendly too!",5,1
"My experience may help you. I use a well known VPN provider which I am always connected to /. The app fails -% of the time, with loads of uh-oh's & other issues. Turn ""Off"" the VPN, and in my case, the app performs flawlessly. So what to make of all this? This worried me at first, but I later realised that lots of non-vpn users use Amazon's fully encrypted secure payment system everyday and it works perfectly well, with or without a VPN, as it must. If you use a VPN - give it a try.",5,1
"So far amazon has been iffy. At best. Lost a third of my orders. Although to be fair that may be the local shippers issue. However, it's like pulling teeth trying to get a straight answer from them about what's going on and good luck trying to find out which company is actually delivering. Hopefully this improves, yet I remain skeptical.",2,-1
"Update (March/April ): why is this app suddenly broken and anytime I try to tap on a link (in another app) to take me there, it just... half pops up and then freezes both Amazon and whatever my other app was..? like, really? c'mon now  ///// Original: For the past month or so, app has been VERY buggy and slow. Clunky when trying to add items to list, check out, or sometimes even when just trying to load a page. Love Amazon, but please update/fix. [Galaxy S]",3,-1
The things you do at Amazon you can do it all on The Browser I don't understand what is its advantage...please someone plz tell me it's advantage and the only thing I don't like about Amazon is that they don't have like free things I meant that I have seen many apps that give you free things or things at very low price when you buy many of there products and Amazon should add a system that you get gifts for buying more and more things and the things should be useful. That's all i wanted to say..,4,-1
I hate how the menu is at the bottom of the home page now. Why did this get changed? It does nothing better & makes the drop down menu inconvenient because you have to scroll & scroll where as the way it was (on the top & down the side) you could see everything at a glance. This is extremely annoying and has no purpose in it being changed to the bottom!!!! PLEASE PUT IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS!!!!,5,1
"Hey Amazon, I hope this reach someone on staff there. I use the Amazon app for Amazon Fresh Market for groceries every now and then. And I learned there is no receipt when my groceries arrive. I write down what I added into my cart just to be % sure all of my groceries arrive. I am not sure if there is an option to request missing groceries paid for but that would be an amazing addition if it do not already exist. Other than that. Phenomenal app!",5,1
"Used to love shopping here. Suddenly, I cannot get my language preference to stop changing to Spanish everytime I open the app. It doesn't let me change it to English at all. Can you please suggest a fix? It's deterring me from using the app. Also, I realized there's no easy way to contact Customer Support except for calling them...",1,-1
"Bad customer service. Some bug in their system. Most of my orders since last one year of my membership keeps getting cancelled without an explanation while I keep waiting for orders. Last time I was told by a representative make single orders (said happens sometimes) which should work. Still same issue. I pay prime for nothing while I can't even get my orders. Tried changing passwords, laptops, phones.. nothing works. Nobody to explain why and what the issue is.",1,-1
"I have used this app for a few years now without issue. Unfortunately, the app has changed my language preference from English to French. Every time I finally figure out how to switch it back to English, the next time I go to the app, it's back to French. Please fix this problem, or you will lose yet another customer...",1,-1
"since update everyrhing on the interface has changed, did you think it would be funny to change the look and functionality of it backwards? Who asked you to switch it, did I? Certainly not! These things should be options not forced requirements. Also since you switched my interface from left top to bottom left the functionality of the options bar is so slow as to be virtually non functional.////No Thank You!!!/ Ps. Also no way to uninstall update Am not a fan!",1,-1
"Very angry with my experience!!,I have an order that's now late. The delivery date has been changed twice, seller ignores my emails and I've emailed them twice spent $. It's a Christmas gift ordered it in November.",3,-1
"Amazon delivered my package to the wrong house and refuses to redeliver/refund. I contacted customer support multiple times and even shared photos of my complex because the ""photo evidence"" that Amazon shared was a photo of a completely different house. When I notified Amazon of their error, they suggested that I file a police report! Amazon made the mistake and then tells me to contact the police and report my package as stolen? What kind of logic is this??",1,-1
"I use this regularly it is good except for these points: - the search facility leaves a lot to be desired. No ability to customise cost. There are ALWAYS completely unrelated items in the search that aren't sponsored. Put a broad search term in, brings up several hundred or even several thousand results, as soon as you then ask it to sort into low to high price, or customer rating, a huge number of the results disappear. - finding subscribe and save items is very difficult. No easy way at all.",4,-1
"Though the app works fine, it always changes to French automatically. Every time I open the app on my phone, it's in French. Then I need to go to language settings and change it back to English. Upon doing this, the app is on English only when looking for products; the entire settings section is still in French. All of my phone settings are English. It makes no sense as to why Amazon keeps changing the app settings to French when I open the Amazon app.",2,-1
Update. No help at all... as a member no packages are on time. $ a month isnt all that. I can't get a refund cause I don't have the package that they sent to the wrong address. No way in contacting customer support. I ordered airpods pros. They ended up missing/lost in transit. I got them replaced. But I ended up getting used airpods pro! I ordered another product and the delivery person gave it to it wrong person. Don't become a member cause no benefits and orders are always late and wrong!,1,-1
"Overall, I am very happy with the app. The only thing I would say it needs improvement is checking messages from vendors. You can read them on the app but you can not reply, then you need to sign in on a browser and finally from there you can reply and upload pictures, and when writing the keyboard disappears, very annoying when writing a big message/explanation of your case to customer service. Is it anyway to improve this, please? Thanks in advance.",4,1
You have to be careful of the search results. Even if you search for a specific model or part number it will give you random results. If you did not know what the part looked like you will buy the wrong thing. There also needs to be a way to put negative search terms with a minus sign to weed out the bad search results. I would like to be able to easily sort and filter results to buy items that are sold and shipped only and directly by amazon. For some items I would not want third party.,2,-1
"When I click on my orders, the screen just continuously loads and nothing ever appears. Doesn't matter if I kill the app and reopen it or restart my phone and open it. When I go to look at one of my lists I can't scroll all the way through it anymore. I can only see a few items.",2,-1
"There is now an Alexa bubble in the app. Talked to customer service, and they said I can disable the bubble in the Alexa settings. Welllll, I have to enable Alexa before I can disable the bubble....... Funny thing is, Samsung did the same thing with Bixby. I no longer use Samsung products. I guess this is goodbye Amazon. We had some good times, then you tried to force a product in me.",1,-1
"Can't find anything in a specified search. Results shown unhelpful. Large view photos won't load, just buffers endlessly. Poor organization, useless layout, pointless compartmentalizion. Massively glitchy, screen flickers constantly then force crashes itself. Immensely frustrating shopping experience. Harshly rated for all reasons stated.",1,-1
The app on my phone has been freezing. Not letting me look at my previous orders screen. Has a constant loading emblem. Makes it difficult to return broken items that came that way.,3,-1
"Too many oops dogs. Thought it was a bad connection. Tried on different cell towers and different wifi spots and still an issue. Cleared storage, still oops dogs. Reloaded app still oops dog. The only thing I am glad about is you have several different pictures of all those good little boys",1,-1
"Try to search for ""overmitts ski"" and Amazon redirects to ""oven mitts"". It helpfully allows me to search instead for ""overmitts ski"" but clicking on that changes my search to ""oven mitts"". Seriously, stop trying to over-correct my search! I literally cannot search for the product I want!",1,-1
"App never functions. Always get the ""Uh-oh! Something went wrong on our end!"" message. Tried clearing cache, tried uninstalling. Nothing works. This has been going on for over a year. For a company as big as Amazon, you'd think they'd be able to hire an IT team that can actually build an app that works... ",1,-1
They have this awesome Amazon locker service but it won't work and the app just keeps crashing. Now all my items are going to get returned. Super frustrating that I can't contact anyone to get it redirected to my house and I'll just have to wait and reorder.,1,-1
"Amazon UK has been my worst online-shopping experience. They kept sending wrong size shoes even in replacement. Ultimately, I had to return the shoes and ended up without shoes. Worst part is, I have to go to a mailing store every time to return the package.",1,-1
"Visually unappealing. Bottom menus are not intuitive, a roadblock to use and difficult to access for many people with joint issues in their fingers. So thanks for making an app with a terrible color scheme that is literally physically painful to use.",1,-1
When I scroll through an Amazon link through a Facebook group. It won't let me scroll. it just keeps going back to their st item on their list instead of an easy scroll through their likes. I update the app. Turn my phone off etc h.its not been fixed in an entire year,4,-1
" stars for now. The app has worked fine for many years over a few different phones, all Samsung Note series. As of  weeks ago I can no longer click and view current active orders, the app just thinks and does nothing, doesn't even time out. I have had my current Galaxy Note  for  plus years with this app, nothing changed, no restarts and never deleted and reinstalled. This is a needed function,  stars till it's fixed.",4,-1
"Makes shopping difficult if you use lists. Lists don't scroll down, can't see everything. Update: scrolling still glitchy. Now I can't rearranged items within a list either, but used to be able to",3,-1
"I have been facing serious issues since sometime now. I cannot browse through the products. Whenever I do that, an error screen pops up with the horse image saying something went wrong from your side.I have placed multiple complaints on this and never found a solution till now. I have no issue when I am using the laptop version. It's only the mobile app is causing me the issue.I have cleared the data and cache, Uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times still have no fix.",1,-1
"It's exactly as described. It's incredibly convenient, and it's great to have Amazon on-the-go. Sure, there are some things missing, like Wishlist, you can't move items or add comments. Other than that, though, this is a good app if you would like to just go shopping on Amazon. Would recommend.",4,1
This app has the potential to be very good! HOWEVER IT DOES NOT WORK WITH EXPRESS VPN! This is a crucial flaw as more and more security conscious and savy people now use a vpn for security and to protect their online Identity! PLEASE sort this serious security issue Amazon! THANKS!,1,-1
Hate it,1,-1
I have cancelled my Amazon Membership  times. Confirmed it was cancelled every time. Checked my Amazon prime account to see that I did not have one and they have been charging me every month for it. I started emailing the help center of the fraud. They'd respond back in a different email there is no fraud then reactive my account. Corrupt as can be. I just wanted to cancel my Prime not never use Amazon again. But now I'll never use it again. I never got a refund for the money they stole.,1,-1
"Horrible customer service. I received a $ gift card and set up an account. Ridiculous because they require another method of payment to begin with. I started an account,placed an order and it was locked for suspicious activity.... I guess getting a gift card is suspicious now? They so far have required a photo of the card itself, The original receipt, my bank statement and a photo of my debit card itself. My account is still locked, can't talk to a person in that department they claim. F--",1,-1
"They keep changing the app, making it confusing and hard to navigate. For example, to get to my Subscribed items, do I click on Subscribe & Save from the main menu, the way it was done before? No, that would be much too simple and logical!!! Instead I find the much smaller Account option buried in a drop down menu, click that, then click Your Subscribed Items. Honestly, I'd rather shop at AliExpress -- it's Chinese, but less confusing than Amazon -- and I don't speak Chinese.",2,-1
"Online shopping giant Amazon, its brilliant when it works but at the same time you have to be careful for the fakes goods too. They have got a good system of posting and returns if your willing to pay the Prime membership, I do because my whole family share it and we certainly use it a lot, only back check the prices because some charge far too much for a product. Still saying all that it really helped during Covid and in lockdown, so yes definitely will keep using for now.",4,1
Terrible returns experience. Amazon invests heavily on delivering products but makes it difficult to return items or get help with convoluted system from customer service. Makes buying products a stressful headache.,1,-1
"Love amazon, never had problems until this update. The ""your orders"" page wont load and just keeps trying to refresh. One of my orders was cancelled, but i cant figure out what my order was or I'd try ordering again. With the older versions, i could talk to customer support but that button is now alexa and she wont help me with anything.",2,-1
Get a issue with app nitce trying to pick up items at locker. First experience. Untrustworthy. If I can't get these they get returned amd refunded. I am not happy about Amazon's issue. It is creating issues for me!,1,-1
"I've purchased  Amazon tablets among many other Amazon devices without any problems. I've spent pretty close to a million dollars on there over  decades, including the subscriptions I had through them. I bought my gs a fire tablet for Christmas back in October. He didn't open it until the beginning of January. With case & screen protector the screen broke when he dropped it while walking. They refused to replace it or refund it although he has only used it for  months. I canceled EVERYTHING!",1,-1
Can't see my orders anymore. This has been since late February/early March. I use the app on an Android. It just flashes like it is pulling up the data only it never gets there (just keeps flashing). utterly useless.,1,-1
"They forgot about android users. Ever since i updated to Android  (now over  months ago) I can no longer access amazon lockers. This means i've ordered the same  items  times now (and counting) in the hopes that either the app or the locker would get fixed, but the app crashes (often completely) once you start the pickup process.",1,-1
"Update... I reinstalled the app a while ago, and it seems to work much better for a while. However once again it has started to slow down, and a simple search for something takes forever. Deleting again! I've used this app for years, but recently they have changed the layout and inserted Alexa into the app which slows it down terribly. I will be deleting this now, because I don't have time to spend waiting for this app to do even the simplest tasks. Amazon has really screwed this one up!",1,-1
"Tough to find the sign out button. For an app that let's you spend money and has access to your CC# this should be easy and maybe even automated after a time but it seems to be hidden. I managed to find it with the help screen after trying multiple searches related to log out or sign out. Try ""sign out of shopping app"" and it will tell you how. You actually go to the sign in screen and click ""that's not me"" so it only works for honest people.",3,-1
"This has become a joke. The monthly fee is increasing, but the shipping time has also increased. Gone are the days of getting your items in - hours! Welcome to - days at a minimum. The only time I have received items in the normal  hour window is when someone orders it for me and sends it to my address. I place the same order and it won't arrive for a week. No matter how many times you report the issue, they promise the issue will be fixed, and then - *more of the same*.",1,-1
:) not a bad app outside of it having trust issues that are publicly known or the fact that it could disable your account for political reasons. Don't like the algorithm pushing Amazon products that are not to par. When doing a search there is an easier way of doing it instead of their twisted way of controlling what is displayed.,4,-1
"I loved this app and the things I was able to get for holidays and special date nights. However for the past id say three months, my orders get delayed by the app. Ill get notifications the day before my expected delivery date saying that my payment was declined? Because my payment info needed to be updated? Ill update and start the process ALL OVER AGAIN. Recently I ordered a pair of heels, hair piece and nails for my prom times running out and I was supposed to get it on the second Not anymore",2,-1
"The tracking is terrible and inaccurate, they hide orders on your tracking page that are delayed, and the prime two day delivery guarantee is a thing of the past. I have had ONE two day delivery in recent memory while most deliveries I'm lucky to get it within six days. Amazon: don't promise things you obviously can't deliver!",1,-1
"You can no longer cancel subscriptions in the app. Apparently you can only do it on the website, not the app. This was recently changed and there is no other reason aside from Amazon wants to make it harder to cancel so you end up paying for what you do not want. That's shady business practices.",1,-1
"I am a long time Prime customer, but you are slowly chipping away at my patience. Please remove the Alexa bubble head or provide an option to turn it off. This is not something I'm going to get use to, it's annoying and it's effecting page scrolling.",2,-1
"I hate the updated version of this app. I have a hard time trying to navigate & find my orders & leave reviews. I find I actually shop on Amazon less after the app changed about a year or  ago...I can no longer review items not purchased in the last  days smh. As a shareholder in this company for the last  years, I'm not at all impressed with neither my dividend payouts or the app layout.",2,-1
"No longer a Prime Member, here's why; I've noticed seller favoritism on Amazon. If the seller is China based, and they lied about your  day shipping, you will never be able to cancel. ""Until you return the item or deny the delivery."" This could take weeks, but when you contact Amazon to cancel the order they will never let you. The forever frustrated support isn't really capable of doing anything. As long as it's Chinese, and says ""arriving tomorrow"". You're waiting weeks.",1,-1
"Issues with App when trying to print out Return label. I actually have to go online and print it out on their website, which is absolutely ridiculous and inconvenient. I also have an issue scrolling through my orders, it won't scroll through all my current orders. I never had an issue with this app, until some IDIOT decided to change the entire format and change the layout of the app . ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it"" This new version seems to be amateurish and definitely not user friendly.",1,-1
"App crashes every time I try to start a pickup for a hublocker. Amazon support has no way to try and resolve it, other than just returning, rebuying, and reshipping in a couple of days the items that I am  in away from right now. Looks like it traces back to a Bluetooth permission that I explicitly granted,but Amazon app says is not granted",1,-1
"Amazon is my go to site for shopping. However, I can no longer use the app as ever since an update from a while back the app has disabled itself. When I try to enable the Amazon app on the Google Play store, it doesn't allow me to. It will enable for a quick second and disable itself again. I haven't seen many have the same problem. Maybe it's not the app causing the problem? I wish someone could help me on this.",5,1
"Hit and miss. Really bad experience with Android app. Often getting ""something went wrong"" error messages and won't display properly. Had this issue on my last phone and same on my new one. Developers don't seem to address issues.",3,-1
"I loved this app... until an update was done. Im uninstalling and re installing the app to see if it helps. I cant see puchased items of any sort, its taking longer and longer to load any part of the app. The browser works fine, so its not my phone...",3,-1
"App has been broken for years now. Navigate to a product page and then leave the app. Come back to the app and you just get a white screen. Was forever force-closing the app until I realised it just needs a tap of the back button, because it's the product page that's broken. Come on Amazon, this is ridiculous now",2,-1
"What happened? It just stopped working! The app is now super slow to load, or fails to load images at all. It's not me, it's you (I checked!). Everything else on my phone works perfectly, even internet speed tests, but the Amazon app has now become absolutely bogged down with itself.",1,-1
"The app decided to change the language to French and no matter how many times I switch it back to English, it'd be back to French. Even when I manage to change the language setting, the headings are still in French. By the time I open the app again, the setting is back to French. I've never used French on my phone. Since I don't understand the language, it's super inconvenient to the point I can't use the app anymore. It's been  months now. Please fix the issue!",1,-1
The Amazon music app itself is great I just don't understand the removal of the store from the Amazon music app you can still buy songs in the app and you can also browse songs as well but the fact that the store option takes you to this app doesn't make any sense,4,-1
"Can't get to where I can change my debit card. I am supposed to get Prime for half price because I use a bridge card. Started getting billed the full charge. I also get small charge from Amazon on my bill,. Like $. ,$., $.. we do not charge anything we only watch . I am on disability and those small charges add up quickly.",2,-1
"Nightmare! Better off using Web. It loads oh so slowly and remembers screen presses, even though there is no button present when you touch the screen, when the screen has fully loaded, it a button now exists at that point it is counted as having been pressed. Of course this only happens if its a purchase now do not pass go type button. Useless app!",1,-1
"I've set my payment method for convenience store but when I'm going to checkout, I can't make a payment for convenience store (currently living in Japan) and it shows no option for convenience store payment method there. I've updated the application and logout my account but it did nothing. I can't use other payment methods than this, so please fix the problem.",3,-1
"Thought old version was bad. Just updated today and app won't load my orders, every other screen freezes and now I have an Alexa dot on my screen that keeps getting in the way and there's no way to gey rid of it! Quit screwing up what doesn't need fixing!",1,-1
"To many permissions & forced to install to contact support, stopped using an older version as it was trying to track movements as it constantly came up to activate location services even when I didn't have App open. Just crashed during a support messaging.",1,-1
Absolutely tired of Amazon constantly getting mine and my wife's address constantly wrong. Our house is literally  blocks away from where amazon drivers keep dropping our packages off at. We even have specific instructions on our packages and the drivers keep messing it up. Honestly considering never buying from Amazon again,1,-1
I do have Amazon prime so I'm not constantly getting messages to get it actually Amazon prime makes life a whole lot simpler if you do not have it and you can pay by the month or the year all at one time and any service or shopping that I do with my Amazon prime plus books and TV and all that other stuff It's definitely worth it I love it! The main reason I talked more about Amazon prime as because not everybody has it but if you can afford to pay it all at once or yearly It is has been Great!,5,1
"Very average app. Not particularly easy to use, and when searching, it throws up random strange results. Haven't had the app for long but not feeling enthusiastic about using it. Should be easier than it is. Also, looks like it was designed in the early days of apps. Ugly. Surprising from one of the world's biggest companies. Disappointing.",2,-1
"So I recently updated the app and I wish I didn't. Usually, I checkout and use different methods of payment. Such as, using a promo, then covering the rest w/ gift cards/rewards points, etc. This last order I placed didn't let me. It only let me use  form of payment. I don't like that. You should be able to use promo credit, gift card/rewards, etc, if you have it. It was better this way. Please change it back. I can understand not using two different reward points from different credit cards.",1,-1
"My phone updated to Android  and now Amazon apps don't work when I'm connected to wifi. Audible still works on wifi, plus all my other apps. Amazon apps however currently only work if I toggle wifi off and use mobile data. When will this be fixed? Amazon wifi connection worked fine before the OS update to Android .",2,-1
"I've been an amazon customer since , I have been using amazon all the time. But, recently on the app it won't allow me to delete certain items in my baskets. I'm not sure if this is a glitch or what but my mother has been having issues with deleting items from her basket as well and the accounts are separate. It's frustrating having to do orders one at a time. Back to  stars when this is sorted out",3,-1
"Enabling Microphone permissions and using Alexa two or three times inside the app disables any digital assistant outside the app. I like shopping with prime but purchasing mp music on Amazon music is a hassle. It redirects you to Amazon shopping and lets you purchase multiple mp songs you already own as it doesnt tell you ""you already own this""on amazon shopping -which is the only place you can purchase such items. The Heck. You have to call to cancel your order for digital products too .",3,-1
"Fix it please... This app has recently just stopped working properly. I have had the app crash on me, and when I try to see th a orders I've placed and track them, the screen just repeatedly refreshes itself, and NEVER ends up loading. Please fix these issues and provide an update. I love this app, but its proving my membership to be more difficult than it's truly worth.",2,-1
Search for a very specific item have to view  other items to find what I specifically searched for. Fricking ridiculous!!! Quit wasting my time I knew what I wanted before I entered the app. It was very specific. My proposal were completely ignored and there merch was at the top of every list.,1,-1
I really like this app quick delivery usually Have most things I need And it works with small businesses I am a little disappointed with the new latest update on Amazon on Amazon makes it hard to check your orders It used to come up in a list now you got this weird boxing with different items in it and then you're supposed to look at the bottom of it and find your order list so weird I don't like it,2,-1
I've been an Amazon customer since  and I'm about to cancel my subscription. Between them raising the subscription price and just about every single time I place an order for a new item  times out of  I receive an item with an LPN label which I'm pretty sure means it's been previously bought and returned. The convience isn't even worth the price anymore.,1,-1
"Our experience was great until recently when the Alexa bubble began haunting the sidelines of app screens. And, the scrolling become locked in same products at times, probably to force longer viewing of that venders product. I tried to toggle off as many permissions as I could find related to the Alexa prompt or standby bubble. It is still lurking on screen. I'm quite capable of finding what I need or will use different device.",3,-1
"The continues refreshing of the main page is super annoying, also when I go back from a product page it's refreshing again everything and have to start scrolling from the beginning. The app is really slow, pictures loading extremely slowly on the product page, I can't zoom or open them until the page loaded completely, also can't like the product as the heart button has a latency. Phone One Plus Nord",1,-1
Every time I open my app I have to use the back button once to get everything to display. Otherwise I get a blank screen with the amazon header colours at the top. Otherwise the app is great.,3,-1
Good services,5,1
"Literally I could take a dump in a bowl and it would be better for my mental health than using this app. I have had numerous occasions where I would make a purchase and it would not only sign me out of my account but it would cancel my orders altogether. I filed for customer support today, filled out the correct information to get my account back, but the app just froze and shut down. I re opened the app, only to find that I was back at the beginning. You guys need to FIX THIS. This app is trash",1,-1
App keeps crashing. I updated it to see if that was a problem but the problem continues.. very frustrating when I'm trying to get in and out if I'm going to pay more for my products on Amazon I want a speedy check out,1,-1
Went downhill bad. How come every other function can some what operate but when I want to delete an item from my cart all of a sudden the app does not want to work! This has been the most frustrating shopping experience I've had in a long time! What the hell happened to you guys?,1,-1
"Scammers, it a fake app",1,-1
"HELP Something is really wrong since the last update. Trying to bring up my orders constantly goes to orders AND THEN blinks and brings up ""Oops, something went wrong, go to home page"". I can't check on my orders or when they're supposed to arrive. BTW, I'm a cat person, I'd prefer to see them than huge dogs.",5,-1
constant crashing if you have firewall ad blocking. Worked fine for years up until recently. If you can't figure out the names of all the ad servers the app just throws CS errors while browsing or doing anything and refuses to work. Easy enough to just not use the app or buy things from Amazon but it would be nice if they fix this.,1,-1
I was enjoying Amazon until I saw a review of how Amazon raise the prices for searching on the web made think and his totally right I was searching for a part for my paint gun it was $ and then I searched around which was higher and all of the sudden the part was exactly the same price as the competition $ Amazon app is just storing information from your device I and yes I checked with one of my friends for the part it his phone came up  or  $ this is totally unacceptable n corruptive.,2,-1
"STILL experiencing issues with this app a year later amazon! It is NOT our phones! This is YOUR problem from your app! This app freezes, you can't scroll, view photo's, things don't load properly, heck I've been unable to add things to my cart! Please fix this broken app! Is this company even working on a solution for this app?",2,-1
"Prime's billing has poor transparency. I lost my % back on my card to do the no-interest payments, only to have payments that do not reflect those terms, either. On top of problems with their billing, Amazon routinely failed to meet quoted delivery times on overpriced products, despite having at least  local distribution facilities. Terrible value and service quality. Cancelled my membership after a month.",1,-1
"I'm not sure whats going on, but when I'm searching for items, the pictures of the items will load. I've never had this issue before. Also, the fact that this app does not have a customer service option to help with this issue really is a big downfall, so I'm forced to write this review.",2,-1
awesome.....,5,1
Not happy about the new price increase. I understand that costs are going up but to increase it by $ a year!? I'm going to have to consider other retailers that will ship to me for free like Walmart and Target. And I don't have to pay them a subscription fee either. At some point you guys are going to start losing a lot of customers over this.,1,-1
The worst search functionality ever. You can literally type in the name of a brand because you don't have the option of going to their store page directly (another issue with the app) and none of that company's products are in the search results.,2,-1
"Issues I have with app are, . The app opens with a blank white screen everytime it's newly opened (not from RAM). Everytime I have to bress back button to go to working main page. . Review with Images and Review with Videos is super laggy. Touch response is very late too. The swipe mode barely works. Please fix these issues.",3,-1
I hate this app! Every time I open it I get a white empty screen. I need to close it again and then it will open properly. Was the same on Pixel  XL as now on Pixel  Pro. Also the customer service chat shows the keyboard over the input field. So you can't see what you are writing when you try to chat to customer service. Horrid app!,1,-1
"I love, love, love this app and have previously given five stars. With that said lately the app has been very slow and glitches quite a bit. I just uninstalled and reinstalled it. Hopefully this resolves the issues.",2,-1
"I love Amazon, but ever since the most recent update any time I go to look at my orders, it will not generate and shows a blank screen. I have never had issues with this app until now.",2,-1
Unhappy with the app. Keeps freezing every time I look at the options. Have to keep reloading the app to unfreeze it. It also randomly powered off my phone when it froze. Very unhappy,1,-1
"I would have gave this five stars, but I took one star away because that times there are people that sell on Amazon that are not honest. This is not entirely Amazon's fault. Would have to figure out the best way to deal with companies like that. But other than that, I have used that Amazon and I'm very happy with the results so far. I would recommend this as a alternate shopping experience.",4,-1
"Good to look around. Terrible for anything else. Don't look for something in particular, you won't be able to filter results. Don't use it to talk to customer support, since there's no option for attachments, and for the love of the gods, don't use it to buy products that will be delayed or lost in transit. Horrible app for a horrible shopping experience.",2,-1
"Used to be pretty good. Now takes up way too much space on my phone. Most of the products lately are not good as what is advertised & shippers have abused the products, either breaking them or allowing seepage of liquid items. Filters only work for st few listings. Use to be a good app. Use to be a good store.",2,-1
"This app still doesn't work properly. I had problems using it on an older tablet. Bought a new tablet recently and still have issues. Pop up windows don't function properly. All I see is a copy of the screen behind the window, inside the window. Doesn't help me trying to see a product ""in use"" before purchase. Curious why other Amazon apps work without issues, but this one does not?",1,-1
"They relentlessly push you to sign up for Amazon Prime, so much so that you need to be very careful when navigating through a purchase. Recently, when I was placing an order, I inadvertently clicked on a button that appeared to complete the transaction. Unknowingly, it signed me up for Amazon Prime. I reached out to Amazon to let them know I didn't want Prime. I made several attempts via the app and email to cancel the transaction and subscription. It took over  steps to finally cancel.",1,-1
"Still broken, unable to get to my orders. Constant web page errors. When I select the three horizontal line, I get an error message after  minute! These new updates and last update it is not fixed . Doesn't anyone test it first? I used to work in QA HPE, Remedy Corp and we will never release a application that doesn't pass repeatable complex test.",1,-1
"When clicking on an item in my cart, I used to be directed to that item's page so I could look at description, change size or color, etc. After latest update, app won't let me click on any items in my cart anymore. Now I need to re-search for the same item that is in my cart and find it again. Please fix.",1,-1
"Great app that is easy to use, but PLEASE add a feature to rearrange cart items (drag & drop). This would make bulk orders easy to categorize and look over. It would be a great QOL update.",4,1
"Super extraordinarily, Amazing experience !!!!",5,1
"I use this app for most of my shopping needs and apart from a few items that I had to return I have no complaints. Very good app, easy to navigate & sells good quality items. I only order items I need so don't really take notice of deals recommended unless Is one of my repeat orders.",5,1
"Feature-wise this app suffers from the same kind of change-for-the-sake-of-change problem many good apps suffer from which over time has been making it needlessly convoluted. Service wise Amazon has been implementing more and more sleezy tactics (returns not marked recieved until you call, shipping labels requiring out-of-pocket payment, shipping reimbursed for less than actual shipping, and most recently undisclosed restocking fees) providing good reason to explore other options.",1,-1
"Good app and good service. I do have one issue and I can't be the only one. Under the Android settings in developer options, there's an option for ""Force Dark Mode"" under Hardware Accelerated Rendering. This works well with the app except when searching. The text is white and so is the text box, so it's impossible to see what you're typing. I feel like this could easily be fixed.",4,-1
Horrible app,1,-1
"My family and I have used Amazon Prime for several years. Amazon is filled with overpriced and price gouged items. Good deals are no longer to be had. I keep tabs the prices of items that I'm interested in; the same items I'm tracking can be bought far less than the Amazon price point in some cases three times less. Not to mention that two day Prime Shipping is out the window, everything is third party shipped and your lucky to actually find a Prime item.",1,-1
"I'm Addicted! Great prices! I can literally find anything I'm looking for on Amazon. Not only do they give you they're price, but show you other sellers who may be cheaper with the same product and help you order from whichever you choose. If by some chance something is not right with your order, they immediately look into it and fix the situation. Amazon is Amazing!",5,1
"Amazon's website said I'd get a $ coupon for my first two orders if I used the app, so I figured I'd try it. No sign of those coupons once I've installed the app, I can't find it in the menus or find a way to contact customer service. This app seems less useful than the website. What is this even for?",1,-1
"Every time I try to pay for my items I get the message saying ""yes I would like to try Amazon prime"" at the top of Every action that I make. Please stop trying to force prime on your customers, put a different message like"" would you consider joining Amazon prime?"" With the choices ""yes or no"" That's it... and if I choose no That's the end of it and you should stop showing it every time I go to a different page while trying to finish my purchase.",3,-1
I used to never have problems with this app. Its always been a great service but lately its just gone down the drain. The app never wants to work when you want it to and when it does want to work its still messed up. Idk what they did to make their app such garbage but they need to undo it,3,-1
"It's really a worst experience I have ever had on online shopping. To change my address I will have to cancel my order ""if applicable"" and reorder them back!! Also I have put my new address but I came as a billing address ?!! I really don't know what it does really mean and what is the difference.also the customer service agent ""feda'a are really useless"" no solutions to be given at all although she has kept me on hold for a  mins!!!!",1,-1
"They sent my items to the wrong address twice. My items were not delivered  times. Refunds were made  times, but for the cheap ones. My $ and $ items disappeared. Although it was never delivered, nothing was done. never use . when I ask for help about items that were never delivered to me, they blocked my account by saying that you are abusing amazon's help service.",1,-1
"App crashes often. Not able to review orders, states ""uh-oh Something went wrong on our end."" But this problem is never fixed, and customers service is too different to contact.",2,-1
"Please fix your search and filter options. Generally app is good for buying stuff (basket etc), but trawling through gazillions of products without great filters is really annoying. Is it really that difficult to add filters after a category is selected - even basic stuff like colour or dimensions? How useful is it to filter by (the numerous Chinese) sellers? Come on, Amazon, you can do much better!",3,-1
"Only problem i have is with the app. Every time i take something from my cart and save it for later or delete it, it doesnt do it right away. The screen then jumps to the top of my cart. Several times ill then have to scroll back down and try again until it finally does it. Just an annoying bug is all",4,-1
"I'll be honest, I've used Amazon since  and only had very few problems. I was able to return items and get refunds - no big deal. However, I cannot write reviews anymore because of ""unusual reviewing activity"" and Amazon has YET to email me back. They told me to wait  days via Facebook then NOTHING. I'll continue to buy but what's the point of reviewing an item to help others if you're going to keep people from doing so? Reviews are meant to help others!",3,-1
"They've lost another customer after this price hike. All this extra stuff is unnecessary and filler just to give Amazon a reason to jack up the price of their membership. Same day delivery in big cities, huh? Well, what about the other % of the US?! Don't even use most of the things they offer. I spend more time sifting through all the garbage than purchasing what I need. Items arrive dirty or broken. Quality has definitely gone by the wayside. Keep your $ a year!",1,-1
"Amazon's Auto Orders for Saving $ is a total P.I.A. There's always something that is needed now and waiting until my AutoShip day is not acceptable, so I end up ordering now and forgetting to add it to the auto orders. I'd be thrilled if I could get it quicker and still be able to add it to the next best auto orders. But nope not available",4,-1
"I love Amazon Prime. Worth every penny for the simple fact you get shopping, music and audio books. I've been real pleased with this app. The music app is amazing. Thanks Amazon. Loyal customer here!",5,1
Hope for the best,5,1
I was told not to send the  jerseys back because of  inconvenience experience. I have been charged for  now. And I never signed up for Prime..and my checking account bounced because of it. And I was charged twice in either Jan. Or Feb. I'm not happy. Everytime I ordered the pet jersey it came in med. I needed xsmall. The last guy I talked to told me to just do whatever I wanted with them...so I threw them away. Now I'm charged for all .,3,-1
"Great app, just wish .... there was a way to use to cards and pay at the same time. My husband and I thought it would be great if there was an option to split pay the bill down the middle. Just another option of paying and not just one card to pay but two to split. Other then that a great app. Thanks.",5,1
I've ordered items from Amazon twice and got screwed both times! The first time they charge me for Amazon Prime when I didn't even want Amazon Prime! The second time they charged me for shipping when it was free! When I ask for my money back she gave me an Amazon card that I did not want either,1,-1
"Easy to use, but keeps freezing on me while I'm looking through the results of a search. When it freezes, I have to close the app completely and restart the search when I open it again.",4,-1
Why won't Amazon make native apps? This is consistently the absolute slowest app on my phone. Also please stop bundling advertising into the same notifications channel. Not only do I want to disable these but they are irrelevant to me % of the time,1,-1
"Amazon's service is getting awful. I LOVED Amazon! Literally purchased s of thousands of dollars here. But recently they keep on losing my packages. Don't have a  day prime delivery date for ANY item. I called multiple times they say they will fix the problem but never do. I have been using this service for about  years and grew to love the service but ever since they teamed up with USPS, UPS & FEDEX the service has gotten awful. I will for sure not be using this service again!! AWFUL!",1,-1
I hate the new updates. The layout all of it. The fact I can't even use Google voice to text is also very irritating. The text box hides behind the keyboard when I'm trying to chat in customer service. Ohh and apparently they can delete my review. As I already left this review a month ago.,1,-1
I don't know what's happened with this app but it's not opening up my orders page. It'll open up other areas or for searches but will either take too long or won't open my orders at all. I've never had a problem with Amazon's app before and I use it very often to buy items. They need to figure out the problem or glitch! I thought it may have been my phone so I restarted it and nope it didn't help. This is ridiculous!,3,-1
"It made me install this app to report a package missing. When I did, it was a stupid messaging bot. The bot then decided that it was just the status that was wrong and that I couldn't do anything until Friday. I eventually walked the next block over and checked the '' in that street and it was there, but of course I can't actually tell Amazon that because it's a messaging bot.",1,-1
"Trying to cancel subscription sucks!!! On the Amazon app doesn't have the option to cancel; you have to go online on the website to cancel. But, if you go to the website online, it goes straight to the app. They need to fix this!!",3,-1
Ordered an item from wish and Amazon on the same day using -day shipping with Amazon and the wish item has arrived but the Amazon item has not even shipped (this is the second time trying to make the same order on Amazon and the second time it has never shipped) and since they do not offer a refund until the item has shipped they can keep your money indefinitely. Absolute scam will never buy from them again.,1,-1
"Amazon does it the best; easy to navigate format, best prices, free shipping, not to mention Amazon Music and Prine Video. I don't know what I did before Amazon! It has truly made my life better. Their return policy, try before you buy and Customer service is bar none. Keep up the good work!",5,1
"Why can't i get an invoice in the app and im not talking about the ""order total"". Whats the point of the app if there's less that i can access? I really need an invoice for my orders. After i make a purchase using the app i still have to go to the website just for an invoice. That's annoying. Might as well just not have an app. And not even an option to request an invoice.",1,-1
"Terrible. The search engine is inept and inaccurate. The categories are now missing in the app. So if you can't find what you want in the search engine, you also can't browse. Worst app I've shopped in (excluding WISH, which is worse).",1,-1
Over getting second hand items at full price. Chasing down my money when I return or cancel.. you say I save money with prime. But im paying for quality and I'm not getting that every time. Amazon is a giant grift. More interested in getting your money than giving you quality,1,-1
Keeps on changing my language settings every time I open up the app. Extremely frustrating that I have to search for a hyperlink that enables me to navigate to settings menu everytime it does that. This feature is annoying for *some* people.,1,-1
Well I'm going to say again since you took my last review down earlier or deleted it I've never had a problem until I cancelled an order immediately after placing it but was still charged $ and still haven't been refunded my money. Customer service at the beginning was good but as the days went by very disrespectful and unprofessional and I will be closing my prime membership account and will never use or recommend Amazon to anyone. Reatail. Goliath sitting on people's money earning interest.,1,-1
"Frustrating experience trying to shop wishlists. Why can't I find a list in the app when I know the name of and can l successfully access it via browser? It's not my list or a friend's I can have ""invite"" me. The link to the list works fine everywhere but the app",2,-1
"App developers need to be replaced. Who the hell thinks it's a good idea that you can't browse around within the app while chatting with customer service?! Was trying to double check my account details and boom! Chat gone. Gotta start with a new bloke. Fail. Secondly when typing, the developers forget to move the text box so it's not covered by the keyboard as I type. Can't see what I'm typing!! Double fail. If you guys want to compete with eBay, Try start with this app. This is a joke!",2,-1
Great services all the time,5,1
"I got locked out of my account for trying to sign in on my new phone. Instead of asking security questions like a normal security check it wants me to verify on my old device, which if was still working I would have. Customer support can't verify my account since they want credit card info and I use prepaid cards, which I don't have info for once they're spent and thrown away.",1,-1
"Latest release has become laggy very slow, scrolling hit and miss, interaction leading you elsewhere, when you think it hasn't responded, leading you to dual tap, making mis direct worse. Really poor experience.",2,-1
"I used to use Amazon for everything, until their app became so slow and unbelievably frustrating. It takes forever to load, will freeze up, or just send me to a blank screen. The important filters are gone, you really don't know who you're ordering from. My husband purchased some clothes only to find out it would take two months for everything to arrive! Stupid ads for stuff I don't need and wasn't looking for everywhere. Amazon is failing hard.",2,-1
My big problem with the app is that you cannot use Amazon smile unless you enable notifications. I want my purchases to benefit the charity I've chosen but I do not want all those invasive notifications so I only shop online. The app is useless to me as long as notifications are required to use Amazon smile.,2,-1
"Easy to use and I love being able to tell the date an item will arrive. I've had a couple issues, but Amazon has heard me and fixed it each time. I'm very grateful for the people busting their butts out there to pack and deliver my stuff and maintain this website for ease of use from anywhere, especially during this crazy pandemic. Thank yall!",5,1
"Why can't I hide the Alexa feature? I'm probably going to delete this app because of that. There is a constant risk of clicking it unintentionally. Why bother with that when you can use the website. Also, the browsing history keeps turning itself on AND I don't want the useless recommendations either.",1,-1
Garbage,1,-1
Excellent % of the time,4,1
"It's been almost a year now, I was expecting the wishlist scrolling issue to have been resolved but it hasn't. Instead it frequently jams and sticks. Please fix this as it makes browsing my own list a chore.",1,-1
"Why is the menu at the bottom. Can't find any of the account options now as it's not obvious, is a terrible UI choice that doesn't work with the main site. I've been using Amazon since  and I'm getting to the point where I think I'll buy everything elsewhere. It's not cheaper on Amazon any more like it used to be",2,-1
Previously I had given this one star for packaging issues but Amazon has completely improved this year on my orders. They've arrived on time or earlier and they arrive in tact. I am very impressed with how well the service has gotten better and now prefer purchasing here rather than best buy.,5,1
Love Amazon Shopping and I love Amazon Prime. Great prices and very easy to use. Just about anything you're looking to purchase you can find on Amazon. I've gotten great deals with unbeatable prices shopping on Amazon and they stand by you with fantastic customer support. Highly recommend you download Amazon Shopping and be sure to check out the benefits of joining Amazon Prime. I guarantee that you'll be happy you did.,5,1
App does not show certain products' images only when you tap on them to get a closer zoomed in view. It does not happen on all images. It does not happen on cellular connection. Weird issue. Not sure if it's the app or my Wi-Fi (Orbi router and satellites) or my phone. Issue does not happen on my laptop. Need to try on another phone to rule out Wi-Fi issue.,4,-1
"This app is getting worse and worse. Each time I select Profile tab it is trying lo load it from the internet. Why?? Why not keeping ""Your orders"", ""Buy again"", ""Your lists"", and ""Your account"" buttons cached? No need to load these buttons from the backend every time I navigate this screen. Absolutely terrible user experience.",1,-1
"Delivery information pops up at inconvenient times but isn't otherwise accessible. Delivery photo and feedback disappear almost instantly, making it difficult to find packages. Shopping is easy and checkout is very quick, but with some money-saving options difficult to find.",2,-1
The app is good at first it worked well i bought stickers and art supplies but Amazon keeps putting my account on hold for no reason. I tried to buy mechanical Pencils I bought it but then amazon texted me saying they put my account on hold I literally hate this app. It puts your account on hold for no reason maybe I did something wrong during buying the item I don't know. It's been  times they put it I might have to make another account just to go back on Amazon.,1,-1
Good always have cool stuff...,4,1
"I'm a fan of shopping with Amazon spending and buying almost every thing on Amazon. I have fire TV but I'm having so much trouble connecting and staying connected. Did contact Sprint,TMobile and Amazon video still no connection.",5,1
"Great for the overpriced Prime, doesn't have as many options as eBay-which is odd. Has been GLITCHY as of late. I use an android and if I minimize amazon to look at my texts..it suddenly on page  of my search and I stop even bothering. You can search for used peoduct from Amazon warehouse, however you can just just search ""used"" doesn't appear to be a difference. Amazon throws out MOST of its returned peoducts so at least I get to save things from the landfill.",3,-1
"App itself is nice. Amazon is convenient. Funny thought how no permissions are granted yet sights and sounds directly and instantly affect recommendations. You might work on hiding the spying a bit better. And bonus tip: when a customer screams ""*UCKING SPIDERS"" they probably aren't the kind of person that would like to buy them to eat. Creepy part is when the recommendations aren't based on sound.",3,-1
I love Amazon! I can find the best price on everything! I shop on Amazon all the time. And if it isn't what it's supposed to be they quickly return it and refund my account so I can find the right item. I absolutely would recommend Amazon to everyone that shops on-line. It is even better than eBay!!!,5,1
App is better but the live chat is bad when using a phone. Keyboard is always on the top of the text you are typing and there is no way to bring the text above the keyboard. There are other annoying things that need to be resolved,2,-1
"The drivers have failed to deliver my orders more than they have managed to deliver them properly, and I am honestly quite tired of having to seek customer service every single time I make an order. Very disappointing. When I actually recieve my packages, its usually always a great experience and fast shipping. I feel like they need more control in their amazon delivery drivers, and seek out these issues further because its very much a hassle and also concerning.",2,-1
"Worst app ever. Absolutely no care about user experience. It such a pitty that in  having such possibilities you don't care doing anything better. Such a complicated app with nested menus, submenus whatever...it takes tones of time and effort to find what you want and do what you want. Try for instance signing out. Takes some time till you give up trying.",1,-1
Scams and fraud sellers around this app beware of it.,1,-1
"The app has gotten so slow. Its almost not even worth looking at it. When i try to lool at something in a different size or color, it takes almost a full minutr to switch over. The whole app is super laggy now.",4,-1
I love using Amazon for almost all of my shopping. I never stepped  foot in to a department store this past Christmas. Amazon is very fast and reliable and they usually beat the competition. As a matter of fact I just bought a  inch TV which was delivered  days later. I'm a VERY satisfied customer.,5,1
I really like Amazon for almost everything. But please be careful with that  hours groceries delivery service. Your lucky if they do delivered as plan. But other than that. Amazon is pretty good for everything you ever want. It reminds me of the old catalogs service . You need something and can't find it. Pullout Montgomery awards or Sears catalog.and just ordered it,5,1
"Has most everything you need easily accessible within the app, but often covers the typing area when it's at the bottom, as it's not responsive to the screen with the keyboard open, so you have to blindly type & correct, which can be quite a frustrating process. Common with customer service/assistant and anything else that requires an input at the bottom of screen.",3,-1
Poor customer service,1,-1
Amazon sent me the wrong item when i ordered  fire sticks for Christmas. I contacted Amazon and they immediately sent me the fire sticks with instructions on how to return the wrong item i had received. I returned the item and was still charged for it. Amazon hasn't refunded my money. Not very happy with Amazon right now. I'm thinking I might just have ti start shopping on eBay again,1,-1
"Filters really let it down. I tend to shop elsewhere a lot of times because of the filters. You cant for example shop ""low to high"" despite the option being there. Because suddenly half the items disappear. Why? Or the first  results are nothing like what you typed in the search bar. Tried to search / dolls house stuff. Only brings up /. So straight over to Ebay. A filter for UK only would be cool. So i can shop locally. (Eco friendly.) And a where the item was manufactured filter.",2,-1
App is broken. Screen won't adjust when you open the keyboard so it takes forever to type out the correct thing. Can't get anyone at Amazon to listen to me. Customer service keeps knocking me off chat because they think I'm gone if I don't reply immediately but it's impossible to reply because the app is broken,1,-1
"It's an okay app that gets the job done. Something annoying however is that notifications about my shipments and advertised/promoted products get pushed through the same channel, so it's impossible to suppress one but not the other.",3,-1
"When I'm in support chat and trying to type, the messages can't be scrolled up so I can't see or tell what I'm typing.. the keyboard is just stuck there. Please fix!! Also, why is the option to get an invoice no longer there on the app? Instead I have type a separate link and type in the order number in the link in order to obtain an invoice for a certain order.",2,-1
Amazon is the greatest shopping app ever! Two and one day shipping is incredible that no one can duplicate! They have a wider selection of products than Wal Mart and more items to choose from and prime membership gets you access to EVERYTHING associated with Amazon! Fast delivery music movies books etc I don't care the price is going up for membership either. As much as they offer for it and as much as I'm paying I thought I was gonna get in trouble for over using it,5,1
"Horrible app & Horrible Customer Service. I have been a loyal customer and KU Subscriber for many years. Amazon decided to cancel my KU subscription on it's own because it decided to process my payment day's after it was supposed to. I'm on a fixed income and thought my payment had been made when it was supposed to. Now I'm told it's my fault that it was canceled for Non-Payment, for a payment that I thought was made.",1,-1
"Amazon used to stick by Prime delivery promises and had great customer service. Now every other time I order, the delivery is late (all overnight shipping/deliver by  AM claims are false. NEVER got one in time, now I don't even try), packaging sucks, returns/refunds are difficult, and 'customer service'? Nonexistent. Terrible monopoly company that I hate supporting, but they've tied our hands with what USED to be 'convenience'.",1,-1
"App sucks. Since the update, the app is ridiculously slow, and when the app finally loads, scrolling and shopping is impossible! The shipping times are ridiculously slow as well for Amazon Prime membership! I will be cancelling my membership and will shop eBay instead.",1,-1
"Latest update makes app worse. Can't access chat support without going thru web version to even find the option. But one feature that was great was on the orders page. All pending and ""to be shipped"" items listed first followed by delivered items. This was a great very usable feature. Why take that away. Will adjust rating when fix what wasn't broken.",2,-1
"You'll probably come to using this app a lot. It's nicer to look at than their website, the stuff you buy is usually pretty good, it's very convenient, stuff arrives well and refunding stuff is easy. The only real bad thing about the app is that it can be hard to find certain sections, eg the ""Message Centre"". Just remember you are buying from Amazon at the end of every purchase - the technical side isn't great, like sometimes receipts don't add up individual items to exactly the right amount.",2,-1
"Everything else looks great and doing fine. Only issues is when I use the scroll up in my wish list or favorites list, the screen won't let me scroll up and it keeps undoing my scrolling up. It'll bounce right back to the same position.",4,1
"I'm beginning to not like the app. It seems to be very very glitchy every time there is a new update. It just gets worse and worse. The last update really sucks. Everything is so very slow to load. Amazon, please fix this!!",1,-1
"I purchased items which did not fit. I returned both items and was told a refund was issued on Jan. . Today's date is Feb. , , still no refund in my account. I have been trying to contact Amazon for the past few weeks, only to not only being given the runaround, but not being to reach customer service by either text, email or phone. I'm feeling like this is the biggest scam and will no longer purchase or deal with this scamming company.",1,-1
"Keeps getting worse... ) Reviews are filtered so scamming sellers/distributors don't get bad reviews. ) WholeFoods used to be free / included with Prime but now costs *** $ delivery each time ***!!! ) Since WholeFoods is no longer included in my Amazon fee, the fee should decrease with the decrease in service. Plenty of other grocery stores to choose from. The app only works on WiFi, not mobile data which is VERY inconvenient. (Watch this bad review get deleted like my last one)...",1,-1
"The customer service chat needs serious help. The keyboard covers the text box so I can't see what I am typing. Then when the chat closes and the feedback page opens, it never loads correctly so I can never leave feedback for the poor associate working.",1,-1
I would probably order even more than I do if I could view my lists. Most of the time I can't scroll down on the app so I have to type in what I remember is on my list when I want to order something. This is a longstanding glitch that never seems to be fixed. I have a Samsung S+ and it works fine with every other app on the phone. I hope someone fixes the issue soon.,3,-1
"It's been pretty good, but the forced move away from the Whole Foods app was the biggest mistake ever. I liked the interface on the WF app. It was WAY better at helping you ""buy again"", and every time I'm shopping for WF now, and I enter something in the search bar, it searches ALL of Amazon. Not needed. Way to muck things up here people.",2,-1
"App doesn't work. Messed up all my lists. The app on iPad works much better. Now I updated it and I cant really add things to my wish list at all. Nothing has improved. The app could be so much better but they don't bother. Difficult to view prices, manage wish lists, etc.",1,-1
Used to be half decent but the last update made the search refining options a joke. Every selection automatically throws you out of the menu meaning instead of being able to click down through the list like you used to in order to get the level of filtration you want you have to start at the top and work your way down one step at a time. This last update seems to have made it even worse.,1,-1
"Very frustrating returning multiple items &keep track of what goes with which label.Say you order multiple pairs of jeans, same brand, that only slightly vary in color.There's not enough in the description to determine which pair it is, have to open each order, then return to the list of your orders.It refreshes the list and changes the order of the items, EVERY SINGLE TIME! Makes it very difficult to keep track of. Trying to communicate with customer service via chat is a nightmare! Phone #?!?",2,-1
"as expected, amazon is just a name! But no interest in giving a % service, from all the reviews and complain i have no more to say but to agree to them. app is bad, service is bad, CS are bad in communicating as well and the worst thing is they will not do anything to provide the best service even though they have all the information about the costumer, Late is late, its okay to them. they will forcr you to cancel the item.",1,-1
I can't believe that it has taken me this long to review my AMAZON APP!? I have been a customer and fan of AMAZON since I received my st Kindle reading tablet @  years ago. I have installed the app on everyone of my cellphones since. I just received the newest update on my cellphone and it is the best and easiest shopping and account/device management experience yet...as I'm sure that's what you're striving for! Just absolutely love it and I buy everything from it. Don't need another app!,5,1
"I enjoy amazon alot. Its a wondeful idea and great app for really any needs. miscellaneous things, music, and entertainment. It has it all. I wish we would get a warehouse near our city. Not only to create more jobs but to get the drone to drop off packages. lol",4,-1
"Amazon isn't what it used to be. The last  items I've ordered has either arrived wrong or never shipped at all (there was months between orders) when calling customer service, it always turned into a nightmare of misunderstanding, due to them not speaking English, or outright lies. Save yourself the trouble and shop on ebay. Or anywhere else. Prices are similar and at least ebay cracks down on the B.S when it's needed. (BTW, my last order was a book. Amazon is KNOWN for books and still failed)",1,-1
Its a good app,4,1
"Customer service is based in India and a few of them are extremely rude for no reason. They also do not know how to do anything except returns, refunds, and replacements so if you have concerns about your account they are useless and cannot help. Things almost never arrive in  days anymore. Amazon Music subscription is constantly pushed on you and they have charged me for it despite me not signing up for it. I've cancelled all my subscribe and save and started buying in brick and mortar stores.",1,-1
When you shop with ebt you have to look all ova the place for items. The food shopping experience is terrible. It needs to be more organized and stream lined as if you were shopping in a grocery store.,1,-1
They make you use Amazon Fresh for buying water. For this I had to sign up to Prime at a cost. I added x  packs of water but it did not reach minimum spend. I tried to add more water but  was the maximum I could add to my order. I had to add items I didn't need just to buy water. I ordered my items and they were not delivered. They said I'd get a refund but I it is up to a week for some reason. I tried to order again but now it says I ordered the max amount.,1,-1
"This app sucks, wishlists are now broken everytime I scroll on one it glitches out and teleports me back to the top of the list. The app is too cluttered, I can't find half of the features thank god they didn't move the search bar or it would become completely useless.",1,-1
"I just updated it , and it still works the same. It wont even let me do nothing with my payment to continue and purchase what i need . im getting very fustrated with it. Ps was never contacted once i emailed my problem. I had to call them . I loved Amazon for the last couple of years. But now its pretty awful . I have to have a credit card in file to make a purchase with a gift card? That doesnt make sense .",1,-1
Until recently my experience was  stars Now maybe . I've subscribed since  and always enjoyed the prime video. I've also enjoyed shopping and had no problems until recently. My payment method is not updating and therefore my subscription has been suspended and van get no further. Trying to resolve without canceling subscription but may have no other alternative.,5,1
Ofcouse Amazon very reliable,5,1
Amazon can take away your option to post reviews without any warning or reason why. And if you question it no one can/will tell you why. The options to sort my list from high to low has been removed. The option to change my main list from a simple line list to a side by side list has been removed. Please fix.,1,-1
"The changes Made to the app is making the experience very frustrating the app is getting worse with every update bug are not getting fix and glitches and crashes every time making the app unusable it is very frustrating because we pay for a subscription every month to have a better functional app experience but this is not deliver I am very disappointed, I use to love this app but not anymore because this issue and not be corrected what a shame",1,-1
"Amazon guts local businesses, charges for Prime Video ( while still charging fees for most features), and their drivers continually drive through my property as a short cut. My repeated attempts to contact someone and discuss it are ignored, even the drivers I've cornered never seem to pass the word along. It's getting more and more frustrating, but Amazon is apparently too big to care. #BoycottAmazon",1,-1
" years ago, hands down the best shopping experience. NOW it takes too long to get purchased items after they charge $ annually.  to  delivery days on common items is not a ""PRIME"" worth experience. Seeing what else is out there.",1,-1
"I love Amazon, but I hate this app. Slow, clunky, keyboards cover important details, can't sort... I use it when it's all I have, but I avoid this mobile app as much as possible. It works, but It's amazing to me with how much time and money at they're disposal, they still have one of the worst company apps available. It makes me leave items in my cart so I can look at them better on PC... This is worse than the History channel's streaming app, haha. Hard to top, but somehow Amazon managed.",2,-1
Always glad to have shopping options in a rural area. Love the prime no shipping feature. Only issue is not being charged at time of purchase. That hits differently when you're not expecting it.,4,-1
Horrible checkout set up. Saying I don't have enough funds when the app is set up to automatically charge for faster shipping is shady. It should be set up so the user can select free shipping after confirming address. If I could give  stars I would,1,-1
I would be lost without this service . during the virus and illness. I can access anything and everything I need . From fresh fruit and veg to general groceries and unusual items too . Well worth paying for prime .,5,1
"All information provided by the app ans Amazon as a whole is speculative. Don't believe anything especially shipping times. Refund processing is a joke. Customer service reps barely speak much less understand english. They are very good at providing empty meaningless apologies. I have permanently deleted my account Ebay has much easier navigation, and your order almost always atrives early. Amazon can't do that!",1,-1
"Since the newest update everything runs so slow, if it even loads at all. It shouldn't take over a minute for the account summary page to load, just to take even longer when I click on orders. If you want people to go back to using the internet instead of the app this is a good way to do it. Please go back to the way the app was before, when it actually worked.",2,1
"Perfect, make me search for my account or lists! Do your developers actually buy anything from Amazon? Omg, I finally clicked on the bottom right in a blank space and the menu button appeared. Most companies engage in uat, or even beta testing to avoid this experience for their users. Get it together Amazon.",1,-1
"Amazon desperately needs to get its act together in terms of its delivery service. To say its very poor, to goes beyond that. Cancelled a recent item because of this. It needs to introduce hr time slots like some supermarket deliveries do - so customers know exactly when to be around, rather than guess what time Amazon will deliver.",1,-1
I just had an absolutely horrendous time signing in because this stupid app asks for a million things other than your password to prove you're not a bot. I was entering the characters on the screen correctly but it wouldn't accept any of my attemots. What's the point of having a password if you can't use it to sign in and you need to complete some impossible puzzle first? I'm furious right now after this exuberant waste of time trying to sign in. Get it together Amazon.,1,-1
"Customer service are not qualified enough to help. There is an error on my click and collect address so I connect this morning with CS to change this and I have been on the phone for last hours with + people and no one could change this! Great ""prime""!",1,-1
"Not a bad program. Purchases in it are made without problems, but I can not find absolutely all the functions and all the information from my account in it, as I can do from a full version website through desktop browser.",4,-1
"The application isn't even working on my phone, it just doesn't start and there's no way to fix it. I can't even chat with Amazon client service because the chat only works via the app. I guess I won't use Amazon anymore for those reasons. Very annoying.",1,-1
I downloaded this app to try whether it would be better than the web version BUT unfortunately it was missing one super useful feature - choosing the items that I want to proceed for checkout without erasing the others from my cart or moving them to wishlist. Other than that I feel like it's slower than when browsing on the web version (might just be my case). At this point I don't see the real value of keeping the app.... which I'd really like with the mentioned feature.,3,-1
I used to love Amazon but lately they've been very bad. I doubt I will order from them again. I paid extra to have delivered next day. Not even a message saying it wasn't gonna come next day or even give money back. I called to cancel and they refused said I'd get it in  days. I needed now thats why I spent extra not in  days. Still no product no money back. Unbelievable,1,-1
"They keep closing accounts without valid reason. I was told account violated terms and conditions. I didn't violate anything. The messages are generated by a canned response system, it's impossible to talk to a real human being. They are indeed from Amazon but you closed ny account for a really made up reason. I'll shop elsewhere.",1,-1
Since the last update I can no longer download music I've payed for to my actual device only the Amazon Music app which makes it pointless to buy the songs now lol. As the app always crashes and is unstable. This is obviously to make you get a Amazon Music subscription which I will not do and if this issue is not resolved I will be deleting the app and will never buy a song from Amazon Music ever again.,1,-1
I mainly use the desktop for the simple reason that Amazon takes it upon themselves to constantly shows me live streams for things I never in a million years would buy. This of course consumes large amounts of data usage. Give us the option to turn this feature off.,1,-1
"I have had no problems from Amazon for years since I've been shopping. I am an international shopper and I always get the right product, good quality despite my waiting time. Recently, however, I have a problem viewing my shopping cart. I will either have to change my password which does not work, or I will have to uninstall and reinstall the app which is inconvenient. I hope someone is able to fix that issue.",4,-1
"it's not about the products, it's about the usability of the app. I can't just scroll down my cart list and choose something i want that's near the bottom without it automatically loading in the next page and going there. just let my click a more button ",1,-1
"It's not like you pay your employees a living wage, so why is this app so terrible? ""Add to List"" on an item is still a link that works maybe half of the time it's pressed. If it does work, there's a massive delay that often leads to clicking the wrong list. It's been like this for YEARS and it's a basic function. No excuse at this point.",1,-1
"Latest design overhaul is absolutely awful. Just no sense to it. And your suggestions (notification ""we thought you'd like a new car seat"") are terrible, I have no children and have never looked at such products. Algorithm seems to have a mind of its own. Also, the keyboard now covers the input field on a live chat to customer support, so you can't see what you're typing (Android basics!!). Back to the drawing board.",3,-1
"My biggest issue is that the app never saves my preferred safe place choice for items when i'm not in - i have to select it everytime even when the ""save my preference"" is ticked. And even then, when i go back into the same order to track it, nothing is selected. Some places my packages have ended up in are bizarre because of this. Really disappointed - please fix this.",2,-1
"This app has become so bad at everything! Prime is no longer prime, expect it in a week if you're lucky! So tired of seeing it's running late, love to see amazon run late, when it's time to take my money, when it's time to renew my account..... Not afraid to say Amazon prime is losing it's appeal.. might give walmart plus a try.",1,-1
For first time ever..im giving amazon a bad review...now you CANNOT print a QR label for dropping off at KOHLS. I repeat i am not allowing scanning of my phone...one way or another it gets touched..or timesout before they get around to scanning. RIDICULOUS that a customer cannot print a return code if they want to. The most irritating thing is customer service could not explain to you that it was not allowed after update a month ago,1,-1
"The most infuriating, broken-down garbage app in existence. You're lucky if you can get it to work consistently for more than a minute or two no matter the device and no matter how much you clear the cache, etc. Just utter bull excrement.",1,-1
For a while this app has been buggy when trying to scroll through my wish list. Did it on my old phone and my new one and it happens on my partner's phone too. All android phones. When I swipe up to scroll down the list scrolls at first and then goes back up to where I was so I never end up further down the list. This needs to be fixed.,1,-1
Really frustrating and I can't use gift cards I've received for even one tenth of what's on it without having to add a credit card there's no easy way to change wishlist other than clicking on the item and adding it to one then changing it to add it to another.,2,-1
Everytime I use Amazon it's super quick. Amazon has everything I need! The deals are good! The response time and refunds are quick if needed. The return process is super easy. The reviews for products are accurate and very helpful. If I want something all I have to do is get on Amazon and it's there!,5,1
Recent update completely changed app. Now it sucks. I don't understand the insistence on overhauling an app just to make everything harder to find. Should leave an option to use app in the pre-changed state. For those of us who don't get all gooey for irrelevant incremental changes.,1,-1
"I ordered an item from Amazon store and the expected date pass and unfortunately they didn't deliver the item and when I contacted them, their reply was we will refund the money sorry if I need to lend money to companies it won't be like that. So, you guys need to get the item delivered to your clients instead of taking and refunding back. I need the item not the money.",1,-1
"The Amazon app is outstanding!!!!! Amazon has got every aspect of your Shopping experience covered so that you can access everything you need from questions answered, to returns, troubleshooting your account, to Subscribe and Save, and so much more!!! You've always got what you want or may need  hours a day,  days a week and  days a year...with the touch of a button. I just Love Amazon!!! Been with them for many years now as a Prime Customer. I look forward to many more years to come.",5,1
"This app is super laggy, it erases search items in the middle of shopping. I keep getting the message that I'm not connected to the internet despite every other app working fine. If the goal is to make me shop elsewhere, you've succeeded.",1,-1
Great app! No functionality issues that I've found. But I should be able to refine my search to display only products sold and shipped by Amazon. You can do this on the desktop browser version. Would be  stars if not for that.,4,1
"Terrible costumer service! I returned a tablet and Amazon says the box arrived empty, even after I provided evidence that I didn't send an empty box. I have returned more expensive items and this is the first this happens to me. What an awful experience. DON'T buy ""expensive"" items from Amazon if you think you may return them. Buy them from somebody that have physical stores. If you are returning something valuable make a video at the ups store of you packing and handling it in.",1,-1
"Uninstalling this app for the only reason that it keeps switching the language to French, and doesn't even offer a way back. Being in Canada, most products have gibberish translations, making it much harder to search in French than in English. All the reviews and research i do is in English anyway. I have no idea why it keeps switching without my asking. I wish it wouldn't get on my nerves the way it does but feeling this hopeless for something so superficial is infuriating.",1,-1
"The new update keeps causing the app to freeze on panes, and unable to scroll through Wishlists, almost as of the page is ""stuck"" it tries to scroll but is somewhat stuck on the slider. Either that or it glitches-freezes and the app closes itself down",2,-1
"Be careful what you order and linking your debit or credit card to this app. Otherwise, your money will be withheld from you for a certain period of days, especially on cancelled orders. I'm now stuck waiting for three refunds for more than  days when that time could've been spent on waiting for an actual product to be delivered.",4,-1
sss tier. Amazon is better to buy from than most stores and even other competitor businesses like scam simulator (ebay). I have never run into an issue that needed additional help from any sort of customer service in all of the time shopping on amazon (probably over  years). Also most of time i order anything its usually either here on time or extra early. One of the first times an item i ordered was late was some time last year (not surprising nor is it amazons fault as covid exists),5,1
Terrible. The app itself is fine. The company behind the app just terrible. For a company that's worth billions they sure do like scamming people. I refuse to use anything Amazon anymore. In one year I had multiple issues with products not being what I ordered followed by returns being a messy awful production. Some returns cost you to return them. The returns also take usually over a month. I'm still waiting for them to even acknowledge the last return. It was delivered to them and everything.,1,-1
"Pretty good. I use it very often for the variety of prices, and the shipping, but many other places have just as short of shipping times. And for equal cost. And the Amazon app doest show me as much variety of products as I thought it would. And often times shows me products that I have already looked at, and doesn't add any more products.",5,1
"Won't waste my time or money with Amazon again. After buying a alternator from them that didn't work, and having a mechanic install it and then had to have him remove it and replace it with a alternator that did work through oriellys, not only had it cost me time from work and money wasted on mechanic, I couldn't get anything more than a store credit return. Now I had to spend my return on items that are no longer able to use prime with since it had expired since this started. Unreal!",1,-1
"Fantastic App. Easy to use, easy to track delivery which is always spot on. Returns and refund recently was completed and refund paid into account before they could have had it back to warehouse, love the QR returns making everything flow seamlessly. Refund for item not received paid immediately all through this simple to use little phone app. Wish all apps were so easy to use.",5,1
New app design is is stupid. Spent an hour trying to figure out where my digital purchases are and had a hard time trying to navigate to other areas of the app . Resorted to the browser website to find them after wasting time on the app. You click on menu and get a mini menu instead of a drop down with all menu options like it used to be. Menu items are scattered all over the place now. Navigation seems to have gone from simple to difficult. Keep up the good work,1,-1
"I can access neither my account details (including past orders) nor the app settings. Both are tabs at the bottom of the screen, but they don't actually work. Only search and the cart actually show up, which is annoying and unusable. At this rate, I am going to stop using Amazon and rely on smaller sellers and local sellers.",1,-1
It has gotten to the point that nearly every item I order offers a subscribe and save option and the app automatically chooses that for me. Getting back to a single order takes several taps to activate. I don't need monthly supplies of button batteries that I need one of.,2,-1
"My last review was taken down. The app is glitchy, there are rarely any delivery drivers available in my area, can't schedule later deliveries because it glitches out every single time. Half my orders end up in the neighborhood down the street from me because drivers are lazy. I pay for Prime benefits and my orders are still delayed, every single time. Why pay for Prime when you still have to wait  or  EXTRA days for your orders? Prime is a rip off. AMAZON IS FAILING.",1,-1
"Sounds like this app doesn't work at all. If it's slow, freezing up on you having to pay shipping and handling after it is also considered in the price from where you are getting it from sounds aggravating to me.",1,-1
horrible,1,-1
"Canceling prime! Delivery is taking longer and longer lately! It'll tell you that you will get your item in a few days but then after you pay for it, within the next day or so it always changes! I bought something the other day and it said  day delivery, now I just checked and it's going to be here in the middle of next month! Walmart is Just as fast and you don't have to pay $ a year",1,-1
"Had pretty bad service with amazon lately. They keep offering me ""free"" music unlimited and then charging my card. The help staff was actually very rude to me about it! ""Should have read the fine print :)"" don't give me that bull, you sent me multiple emails saying it was free and autocharged me! Unbelievable, I don't think I will be renewing my prime membership after this shadiness combined with downright rude and sarcastic ""help"" staff when I asked about it.",1,-1
"The app is fine for ordering etc, but tracking the delivery is troublesome. The map for showing where the delivery currently is gets obscured by all sorts of pop up overlays that can't be removed - I'm currently awaiting a delivery, and can only see a cm stripe of the map! It's useless!",3,-1
"Just get prime membership also it makes life so much easier. This app makes it super easy to get tons of products from all over the United states and the world. Be cautious you can spend alot of money quickly, but its always worth it.",5,1
Well organized but does not list all of my product ratings. Seems like the app is not in sync with my online activity. Sometimes the prices are more compared to online. My last purchase consisted of many purchases. After I paid the purchases were broken up into different invoices. I wanted all the purchases on the one invoice and wonder if I'm being charged twice for items and credited for special discounts. Not to happy about this.,3,-1
So slow!!! The latest app version is very slow and cumbersome... Most of the Customers do not have the latest hi-end 'phones to keep up with the app-bloat! Bring back the faster old version which also had a better menu-driven design.,1,-1
"Please make language settings more sticky! Even though I use two languages and live in a bilingual country, I prefer to standardize interfaces across apps. For some reason Amazon's keeps switching languages. Looks like a documented bug. I don't understand why this app is trying to guess which language a user might want to see - let's have it set in the preferences and keep it that way until the user wants to switch.",3,-1
"Sure it's convenient but it won't stop logging me out of my account and when I try to log back in it goes through a bunch of extra steps, like I'm literally just trying to see when my package is coming. It should take  minutes tops but now it takes way more than that, not as convenient anymore.",3,-1
Items get ordered without you knowing. You go around in circles trying to speak to the right people and my reviews option has been cancelled due to their algorithm thinking im a robot. If it wasn't for the quick delivery on certain things I need I wouldn't use them.,1,-1
"App keeps switching to Spanish. Even when I changed it in the settings literally two minutes ago. Doesn't show me my recent orders. And accessing the settings to fix the weird language switch is a nightmare. I had to Google a link to be redirected instead of using my profile settings. And like I said, itsl still switching to Spanish. The service itself is solid. I get refunds or replacements if a parcel fails to arrive. But damn do I hate this app. Especially now.",1,-1
"I used to really like amazon and the prime free shipping etc, but now vendors are just including the shipping costs in their prices, so why am i paying for free shipping on prime, when I'm having to pay the vendor shipping cost anyway. This is actually making items more expensive than buying things directly from other places. This is just becoming another ebay.",2,-1
"Where the mobile app falls short is that you can't use very specific price filters. On desktop web Amazon, you can. And it's a wonderful tool for digging through results. The filter price increments that are available in the mobile app are too broad and not as useful. I would like the more granular control within the mobile app.",3,-1
Amazon sends texts to me about the deal of the day. When I select the product it opens in spanish for some reason. Since I don't speak Spanish I can't figure out how to change it back. All the directions I can find to change it back are website directions or are how to's in engliah. Not helpful. I refuse to buy any more products from them until this is solved. Jan.   app is still in spanish. If anyone knows how to change it back in app to engliah when you don't read Spanish please.tell me.,1,-1
"I'm not sure why, but the app is always randomly switching language settings from English to French. I was able to go into the settings to switch it back to English up until the latest update version. Somehow the layout of all the options in the app has changed and I can no longer find where to change the language settings. I can deal with navigating in French, but it's just weird that the language randomly switches to begin with, and also weird that it can no longer be changed back.",2,1
"Although they have alot to improve, but simply they are the best in the market. Amazon made it easy for us to buy items that are not available in the country wich is a real unfair advantage. The items used to be much cheaper than local markets. But now I don't feel the big difference except in digitals and electronics they have the best bargain. The orders % of the time they arrive on time. The customer service is really good. However I really wish they improve or remove the prime.",5,1
"Never had a delivery issue. However, the app is poor, you can't review or see the actual invoice of your orders, not sure if due to phone model limitations, if so then it just proves my point, the app is quite poor. I have an A and a A, can't on both.",3,-1
"Amazon is going downhill! First, they have the worst grocery delivery with bait and switch they call "" hours"" when in reality they deliver the next day. Now, you can no longer get an instant refund to Amazon gift card and have to wait for weeks until an item returns to them and then  days from then to get a refund to original payment. I personally set up  returns and chose refund to Amazon gift card, once ups picked them up, they all changed to refund to original payment. It's been  weeks!",1,-1
so far so good,4,1
"It makes shopping easy because I don't drive and nothing good is close. Everything Prime used to have free shipping, now it doesn't, which sucks. Luckily I am moving and will be closer to shopping centers. They also now do Canadian shipping through Puralator, which sucks because there are only three or four in my city. When they shipped through Canada Post returns were more accessible. Oh well, but due to these changes I will be shopping elsewhere. Amazon was my go to until these changes.",3,-1
"The Amazon app service is wonderful! However, I am now experiencing app launch failure since yesterday morning. If I do launch the app, it says ""cannot sign-in due to connection failure."" The same thing occurred again as I used mobile data. I'm using Amazon website for now but seriously, someone needs to check this thing up.",2,-1
"Was promised a refund and now I have been told they can't give it to me. Customer service is a joke, Rude on chat and could care less. They keep pushing orders back. Been waiting on an item I order over  months ago. Was told they never charge when item is ordered but that is a complete lie. I've been charged twice on several items and they don't care. Time to find a new service close to Amazon.",1,-1
"I like this app a lot. Most things ship as you would expect. The issue I have is with anything pre-ordered. My experiences have been terrible. If it's a video game, expect to wait days after the game releases before getting it. (You should buy digital or go to a store for physical copies.) I also tried pre-ordering a small statue for my desk. They canceled my pre-order, then doubled the price of the item. This lost them an extra star.",2,-1
"I'm disappointed with Amazon's customer centricity. They say that they put the customer first, but sellers are their main customers, not us, the usual people. I bought an item for €, but received something else. The seller couldn't give me a QR code for DHL to return the item. They gave me a label for GLS, but I don't have a printer not GLS shops nearby. The support gave me only two options: either I find a printer or pay myself for the return. I'm very frustrated with this experience",1,-1
"Just wanted to let the developers know of a problem that's been around for a few updates. While scrolling your wishlist, it stops mis swipe and goes in reverse. I'm on Android  with a Samsung  Ultra. All other functionality in the app is great.",4,1
"An item I ordered is over a week late, I selected the option to have another one sent to find out it wouldn't arrive for at least another  weeks. Need it sooner than that, so I canceled that order and attempted to request a refund for the item instead so I can shop elsewhere, but the site sent me in a circle of ""Contact Us"" never giving me a contact option. When I finally managed to get it to stop circling, it brought me to the play store to download this app instead.",1,-1
"Ordered a  euro book and when it finally camed, it was washed up and had sticky pages. It was like someone threw it in a pool. We are in the process of returning the item and getting a new one but it's just so annoying, we have to get a ticket so the post won't charge us, we have to go to our nearest supermarket (which by the way, we dont have any cars and the nearest town is hours of walking away in freezing temperature) and ... It made us even more busy and just frustrated.",2,-1
Kinda super frustrating looking for a specific accessory for a specific phone. There is no way to select my phone and then the brand and then the type. I spent  days looking for zaggs invisible shield for my note  ultra. Instead Amazon keeps trying to sell me zaggs glass fusion (which we DON'T want) or it wants to sell me Samsung Galaxy parts. We gave up and went to Zaggs website. Searching Amazon is pretty miserable. Also their drivers do not respect delivery instructions.,3,-1
"I can't seem to find the customer service button as they changed the way the app looks. I think it is more difficult to navigate the app now. They need to stop typing to improve it. I'm j making it worse.... they tell you to order today to get your item(s) by _____ only to send out the items the day before,then they just keep saying sorry when you don't get it  days later. Amazon and the sm. Businesses are a joke! Not to mention, the price can and will go up before they ship it (happens often)",1,-1
"the app is trash. amazon prime is lying trash. went from  day delivery to  days AFTER it ships... could take weeks to ship. can't find contact customer service easily anymore, they always hide that button when things go wrong.",1,-1
"CARD INFO NOT SAFE!!!!!! Hate this app. So insecure. I was just looking at things to buy yesterday and in the hour of shopping on my Amazon Shopping app I ended up with  pending charges for God knows how much without my authorization! One from Amazon LLC, and another from a seller Token Provision I didn't buy what I wanted to yesterday because the shipping cost more than my subtotal. $ subtotal $ shipping. No matter how many items were in my cart the shipping was always double, at least.",1,-1
Amazon used to be great. Now shipping times suck and it's really not worth paying prime membership any longer. I can find better prices on most items locally now. Bring back ACTUAL prime shipping. I will be canceling my membership.,1,-1
"There is no app icon to place on phone's homescreen. I search apps and can't find the Amazon shopping app, yet when I go to app store it says I already downloaded it and gives me the option to open it. Very frustrating!",1,-1
I always seem to have great success with finding items on Amazon Shopping. The prices are equal if not less than other retailers. And having Prime saves me a fortune on shipping charges. Thanks Amazon. You have a loyal supporter!,5,1
"So I'm giving this a  star review. The app is great and all that just awesome. It's the drivers in the company that's not cool. It seems Everytime I order something the drivers screw it up badly and I mean royally my latest delivery Sat , the driver left it outside on my sidewalk out in front of my building of my apartment complex, I've put explicit instructions for this as the app had that option. And it's simple enough this shows how s business starts in the garage the owner could care les",2,-1
"Language bug. There is a bug that switches my language preferences to French on Android even though I have changed it back to English + times. The website is fine and it appears alright on my iPad. Otherwise the app is good, but this bug made me delete it.",2,-1
"App is useless. Half the time it doesn't start. Takes multiple attempts to open. App is up to date, cleared data and cache. I've even recently bought a new phone and the problem persists.",2,-1
"Cannot chat with customer service (not assistant) because the keyboard covers the input window. Many people have complained about this, and yet Amazon chooses not to fix this. I suppose it's an interesting way to keep support costs down.",1,-1
"Bitter experience. Becareful when you use the app, make sure you keep your personal record or invoice of items/goods ordered because the app will not. So that when you want to complaint about undelivered item you will have a record to do so. This is my personal experience. List of items ordered wasn't correctly stored on the app. Unfortunately, one of the item that wasn't delivered is missing, therefore, making a formal complaint herculean expect reference to payment.  star",1,-1
"It always freezes up, and it suggests things you don't want. It also won't let you rate things because of bigotry or race, which is weird because the most awful people are able to rate things, but if you are kind and respectful they stop letting you rate stuff and won't change it no matter what. Still a problem. I'm tired of it. Maybe I should stop using Amazon and use Walmart+. They at least let you review your purchases.",1,-1
"Update: Prime delivery getting pushed farther out for delivery dates. Also there is no ""free shipping."" You're paying for it and then they try deceptive practices saying at checkout ""chose a later date delivered in fewer boxes""...or ""less trucks on the road."" Some returns for UPS pick up cost more now. They're trying to take away Prime benefits with these deceptive practices! Prime is a joke!",1,-1
"Was told I would receive a refund for an unjust shipping charge that was charged to me, but I still haven't received it yet. I wanted to check the cost of sped up shipping only for the app's confusing UI to lock me in to expensive shipping and then disallow me from changing it back. It's been a non-stop headache and the customer service seem like they aren't allowed to work with each other.",1,-1
"What fresh mess has Amazon done. App has gotten awful. It appears they have taken the not so customer friendly route as everyone else. I cannot contact any sellers, that portion of the screen is buried. I've reinstalled the app, restarted my phone....nothing. saving on technical support will ultimately cause this company to lose. I hate unnecessary and inconvenient change.",1,-1
Used to be great. Now I can add items to my cart but cannot access beyond the cart to actually check out. You'd think the main purpose of having a shopping app (letting the customer pay to complete their purchase) might be a priority. Maybe Bezos should invest more in his app team and less on his approve astronaut career... Just a thought.,1,-1
"Worst UIX ever, defected products, and slow delivery time",1,-1
I buy from Amazon all the time and am generally happy. Lately however I have received a few items that haven't been a complete set and I have sent enquiries which I have never had any reply to. I have also had some problems with deliveries where my items have been left in odd places and no card has been left which is really frustrating!,4,1
"Just lil question why do u guys made me update a payment on product after I'd already paid for the product when it was shipped? Because I've order at least  things together and only two things got delivered bc I had cancelled  of them, but it's way too bad u can't get full refund after the app makes u update/paying for it when you cancel the order or something I've even brought another thing on there from seller, and cancelled it bc same problem with ""update payment""",1,-1
A bit slow on my phone otherwise very similar to the webpage. I like that you have all the delivery options visible so you don't have too click on extra options like in the app. Better on the webpage.,4,-1
"I made a legitimate order after verifying their account security email & received email confirmation.  hours later, Amazon emailed telling me that they believe that an unauthorized party may have accessed my account & to protect my information, they have: . Disabled my account for  hours. . Canceled any pending orders & I can ignore any confirmation emails sent. It is unacceptable to cancel my order without verifying with me. Now, the items are OOS. Worst shopping experience EVER.",1,-1
"They make Unsubscribing prime membership very very difficult. I was charged for prime when I was purchasing some items, I have called them and subscription was made my mistake and they confirmed they will give the money refunded buy until now it is not refunded. It is a worst experience",1,-1
